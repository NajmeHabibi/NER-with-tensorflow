High inflation is hitting people on fixed disability benefits hard,"Even before inflation started rising, Murray and Linda Mann said it was hard for their son Kevin to make ends meet.,Kevin, 58, has a range of health problems, including systemic lupus, which has affected his kidneys. He spends a lot of time in and out of hospital, sometimes for months at a time. As a result, he is unable to work and relies on Canada Pension Plan disability benefits from the federal government, and a small pension from his former job to survive on less than $17,000 a year.,Every month is a financial stretch, and inflation is making it harder.,""Money is real tight for Kevin and it has been for 25 years,"" said his father Murray in a recent interview from their home in Belleville, Ont.,""And Kevin is not the only one,"" added Linda. ""There are so many people below the poverty line and with disabilities."",People with disabilities have a higher poverty rate and a lower rate of employment than the overall population, according to , Advocates say it is a longstanding, systemic problem that inflation is making worse.,Murray said Kevin's pension from his former job is not indexed to inflation, so it doesn't rise as costs escalate. While the federal benefits are indexed, they lag behind actual inflation, so he said the increases haven't caught up to the ,The Manns would like to see more support for people with disabilities, like an income supplement that would put them above the poverty line and help offset rising costs for food, shelter and other goods.,Guillaume Parent, director of the wealth management firm Finandicap, specializes in financial services for people with disabilities. For his clients, there are often extra costs to shoulder, like adapted housing and transit, and personal support workers.,Those expenses push the poverty line higher for people with disabilities and governments need to recognize that and adjust to it, said Parent, who has cerebral palsy.,Quebec's disability benefits are indexed to inflation, but Parent said those increases come long after prices have already gone up.,""People are suffering a lot,"" he said, adding he has clients who are no longer able to cover their basic costs.,In Ontario, people with disabilities can apply for the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), which provides income support for qualifying adults with disabilities.,Pascal Kakule, an organiser with the Ottawa chapter of the advocacy group Acorn, uses a wheelchair and relies on ODSP to make ends meet.,The amount he gets, he said, falls short of what he needs, particularly in the face of today's fast-rising prices. What's more, his wife works part-time, which means he is eligible for less money from the province, and the rates have been frozen since 2018.,""That kind of system they are working with, it's very very difficult for people to survive,"" Kakule said.,Kakule,are calling on Ontario to raise its ODSP rates and reduce clawbacks affecting him and others.,A spokesperson for Ontario's Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Merrilee Fullerton said in a statement the provincial government raised social assistance rates by 1.5 per cent when it took office in 2018, and that it's waiting for the federal government to deliver on a promise to create a Canada Disability Benefit, to help boost support.,That legislation, aimed at increasing the monthly incomes of Canadians with disabilities, was introduced by the federal government in 2021, but , died when the federal election was called and the government has yet to re-introduce it.,Carla Qualtrough, the federal minister of employment, workforce development and disability inclusion, said in a statement she plans to revive the bill, but did not give a timeline.,Existing financial help available to people with disabilities varies from province to province and they can be hard to navigate, said financial planner David Truong, chief adviser of private banking with the National Bank in Montreal.,""Not everyone is aware of those programs, that they're out there a lot and not all of them are easy to understand,"" he said.,""Seek out for advice and try to get the most out of the government programs that are available for you."""

Why some RBC customers were wondering where their money went,"It was a surprising discovery for Tanya Shields first thing Friday morning.,The resident of Fall River, N.S., said she logged on to her Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) account to pay some bills with money she received via e-transfer from clients of her small business.,But the money wasn't there.,""It was a little bit alarming,"" Shields said.,She had received confirmation on Thursday night that the money had been successfully transferred, so the fact that it was missing was a concern.,Shields even had her husband transfer money to her in order to ensure that things were working correctly. His deposit transferred successfully.,""Which was more concerning than the money not being there in the first place,"" she said.,Shields says she checked social media and the bank's website, but there was no information that addressed the problem she was having.,She knew banks were closed on Friday and Monday due to the Easter weekend and was concerned she would end up worrying about this for days.,CBC News heard from other bank customers who experienced similar issues.,Jeff Black, a Halifax-based weapons engineering technician with the Royal Canadian Navy, says he logged on to his RBC account on Friday morning and discovered that the $2,355.97 automatically deposited via e-transfers on Thursday was missing.,The money was going to be used to pay off his property taxes and for supplies needed before he heads out to sea for three weeks.,""It did make me nervous at first, considering I received a great deal of money yesterday, and then it was all gone,"" he said.,It was a similar story for Christine Hunt, a controller and administrative worker in Newmarket, Ont. She logged on to her account to find money missing and her account overdrawn.,""I was in a complete panic because that's $1,000. Where did it go? And the fact that it doesn't even say it bounced. It's like it never happened,"" she said Friday.,Hunt found the e-transfer deposit confirmation email but still called RBC to find the missing money. She says she waited on the line for two hours before hanging up.,With her bank account in negative territory, she withdrew $200 from her line of credit to cover a prepayment. But she still has no answers as to when she'll get the money back.,""I don't know what's going to happen. Are they going to charge me because I did go into the red?"" Hunt said. ""The fact that it's not even listed as ever deposited — it's just blank — is just so weird."",Hi Shelley, thanks for your message. We are currently experiencing an issue with e-Transfers, that is resulting in recently deposited transfers no longer showing. We're working to have this resolved ASAP, and we appreciate your patience ^SB,In an emailed statement to CBC News on Friday evening, RBC said it has ""resolved the earlier reported issue of account transfers and e-transfers involving auto-deposits recipients. Clients should now expect to see the funds reflected in their accounts."",The bank went on to say it will ""reimburse the small number of clients that may have incurred charges or fees as a result of this technical issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank our clients for their patience while we worked to resolve the matter."",Earlier in the day, RBC said it had experienced a technical issue with some e-transfers.,""Auto-deposit e-transfers sent between Wednesday, April 13, midnight ET and Thursday, April 14, 11:30 p.m. ET, may not be appearing in client accounts,"" reads the statement, posted on RBC's mobile banking app.,""E-transfers sent outside of that time period are not impacted. We are working to post these entries and reflect accurate account balances as quickly as possible."",A spokesperson for Interac, the primary funds transfer network in Canada, said its service was ""functioning normally"" but that it was aware one of its ""financial institution partners is experiencing an issue on their end."",By Friday evening, some customers, including Jeff Black, confirmed to CBC News that refunds have been issued."
Federal budget signals shift to soon let labour groups launch trade challenges,"One of the country's largest unions says a small change promised in the federal budget could leave a large impact on efforts to prevent Canada from being flooded with cheap goods that threaten domestic industries.,Once the legislative changes are made, labour groups like the United Steelworkers union can launch trade challenges without the need to have an employer join the cause.,The change is something the Steelworkers union has pushed with public servants for five years to fall in line with other nations, including the United States.,Since 2017, workers have been able to appear before tribunals hearing allegations about the dumping of goods, as it's known in trade talk, but decisions were largely based on the industry impact.,Meg Gingrich, assistant to the Steelworkers' national director, said the change will also mean that dispute panels will look at the impact on workers when adjudicating any dispute — beyond whether there are layoffs.,She said the impacts could include companies not keeping up with pension payments or pushing for bargaining concessions because cheap goods are eating into revenues — ""whatever it may be that's injuring workers."",""We didn't have that before. We'll have to see what the details actually are, but it's looking promising in terms of what we'll be able to see with these reforms,"" said Gingrich, whose union represents some 225,000 workers in Canada.,Last year, the government began looking at updating trade dispute rules to give workers greater participation in the process.,An analysis at the time for business law firm McMillan LLP suggested that adopting the changes could not only help bring the view of workers into dispute hearings, but also help businesses by bolstering industry arguments.,The Steelworkers have only been involved in one case under the existing rules. The CBSA earlier this year launched an investigation after the union and Restwell Mattress Co. Ltd. filed a complaint about subsidized Chinese-produced mattresses entering Canada over the last three years.,The budget released earlier this month promised legislative changes that, once passed, would allow workers to file trade complaints if a country was unfairly dumping underpriced goods, or those that circumvent import duties, into the Canadian market.,It was part of a package of promises to revamp parts of Canada's trade remedy system that included $4.7 million over five years, starting this fiscal year, to the Canada Border Services Agency to help small- and medium-sized businesses navigate the dispute system.,""This is years of work paying off and years of our members going and testifying in these tribunals, and talking about the impact of unfair trade on their livelihoods,"" Gingrich said.,""It's to the point where Canada will have some of the most progressive trade laws in the world."""
Why prepared rotisserie chickens are cheaper than ones you cook yourself,"Walk into almost any Canadian grocery store and you smell it. Delicious, juicy, rotisserie chicken. ,It's just sitting there, like a beacon, promising shoppers a hearty meal they don't have to cook or clean up after.,The pre-cooked birds are priced between $8 to $12 at larger grocery chains in Canada, but barring a sale in the meat department, raw chickens can often cost more per bird at those same grocery outlets.,The lower price of rotisserie chickens compared to raw at many stores is despite the additional cost of spices, packaging, labour and energy for the convenient meal.,So, what the peck is going on? CBC Radio's , dove into the henhouse to find out.,Major Canadian chains, including Loblaws, Sobeys, Save-On-Foods, Costco and Metro declined to comment on pricing strategies for their chickens. ,However, Rowe Farms, a smaller grocery chain based in Ontario, agreed to share some inside information. It's been selling rotisserie chickens since 2008.,According to Rowe Farms, it might look like you're paying less for a cooked bird, but you're usually getting a smaller chicken. Raw birds in the cooler section usually weigh between 1.6 and 1.8 kilograms, while chickens destined for the rotisserie spit are about 1.2 kg.,Roasted chickens need to be around the same size to cook evenly on a grocery rotisserie, according to the University of Arksansas' Casey Owens. She's a professor of poultry (yes, that's a thing).,""If they [grocery stores] get a carcass or chicken that's a little bit larger than that, it may not reach that temperature in the the right amount of time. So it's going to be very important that those chickens that they're rotissering are very uniform in size for food safety purposes,"" said Owens, whose official title is professor of poultry science.,Rotisserie chickens are typically advertised with an average weight of 900 grams of cooked meat per chicken.,However even if smaller, a grocery store rotisserie can still be cheaper — by weight — than an uncooked chicken.,As an example, , picked up a cooked cluck at a Calgary Costco.,The rotisserie chicken was priced at $7.99. After removing its plastic packaging and ties, the prepared poultry was weighed on a kitchen scale. ,The roasted rotisserie chicken from Costco weighed 1.35 kg. As poultry ,, to calculate the pre-roasting raw weight of this bird 25 per cent was added to that weight. This meant a theoretical pre-rotisserie weight of 1.64 kg for the example bird purchased at Costco.,At $7.99 for 1.64 kg, the rotisserie bird would be priced at $4.88 per kilogram.,This compares to $6.49 per kilogram for a raw, whole chicken at the same store.,Buying a whole uncooked chicken at Costco will cost you 33 per cent more per kilogram than buying a rotisserie chicken from the same outlet.,One reason why Costco, and other retailers, can offer a discount on rotisserie chickens they've prepared in store is because they sell a lot of them.,Costco alone said it sold , globally in the 2021 fiscal year. The company sells so many, it's been reported the warehouse giant has built , to help maintain a steady supply of bird.,Retailers are also offering a product popular with consumers. According to poultry producers, chicken has been the most consumed ,, as well as ,, for years.,Rotisserie chickens are also a loss leader according to retailers such as Rowe Farms. This means grocers actually lose money on them, and sell them below cost as a way to get customers into stores to ostensibly buy more items., ""Our rotisserie chickens are priced the way they are as a convenience to our members. An oven roasted chicken is a fast and easy dinner option, and our members are likely going to fill their baskets with other items while they are buying a chicken,"" wrote Barb Munro, corporate communications adviser for Calgary Co-op, in an email to ,.,""It's a win-win for our members and our stores."",Experts say grocery stores also rely on knowing customer behaviour and needs, such as wanting to save time.,""When people are under time stress, they take a lot of mental shortcuts. And they often do not do price comparisons,"" said Andreas Boecker, a food economist at the University of Guelph.,""So that leaves the opportunity for the retailer. They can even design the store in a way that after you pick the rotisserie chicken, you see other items in the store and things that are complementary to it."",Potentially that means customers get a deal on a rotisserie chicken, but end up buying side dishes which aren't as good of a deal.,Think of grabbing the tray of mashed potatoes priced at double the cost of making it at home — but a customer grabs them, along with the cheap chicken, to save time.,""That's the other aspect. Do you love to cook and do you want to do it?"" asked poultry professor Casey Owens, who said she can't remember the last time she roasted a chicken.,""I'm a mom of two kids, 11 and 13. I don't have time to go home and rotisserie a chicken. Between baseball and soccer schedules. I don't have the time, but it's very easy for me to go to my local grocery store, pick one up, spend $5 or $6 (US) and have a good meal."",And that's what, according to Owens, makes the rotisserie chicken — kind of priceless.,Cost of Living"
Home sales and average prices fell in March,"Canada's red-hot real estate market showed signs of cooling down in March as both the number of homes sold and the average selling price declined from the previous month's level.,The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), which represents more than 100,000 realtors across the country, reported Tuesday that on average, homes sold on the Multiple Listings Service went for $796,000. ,That's down about three per cent from the all-time high of $816,720 the previous month, and a noteworthy change in direction after the unprecedented tear that Canadian home prices have been on for the better part of two years now.,""While the market remains historically very active, March definitely saw a slowdown compared to February in terms of both activity and price growth,"" CREA chair Jill Oudil said. ""One month does not make a trend, so we'll have to wait and see if this is the beginning of the long-awaited cooling off of this market."",Average selling prices were down, as was the actual volume of homes sold. Total sales came in 5.4 per cent lower in March than they did in February. All told, some 54,957 homes were sold during the month. That's a decline of 16 per cent from the all time record of nearly 67,000 that did in the same month a year earlier. ,March is typically a strong month for home sales, but instead the month represented the biggest one-month decline in sales since June.,Though down from February's level, the average selling price is still up by more than 11 per cent compared to where it was a year ago. But that pace of increase is slowing, too. March's annual increase is about half the ,.,CREA says the national average price number can be misleading because it is so easily skewed by sales in big expensive markets like Toronto and Vancouver. So the realtor group trumpets a different number, known as the House Price Index (HPI), as a better gauge of the market because it adjusts for the volume and type of housing.,The HPI increased by one per cent in March, a ""marked slowdown"" from the 3.5 per cent increase in February, CREA noted. As is the case with the national average, however, the HPI is still up an eye-popping 27 per cent on an annual basis.,Nasma Ali says she's seen signs of a slowdown in Toronto, where she's a broker and founder of One Group Real Estate. While the numbers released Tuesday are for March, she says the trend has become even more pronounced in April, where ""buyer fatigue"" may be setting in after the Bank of Canada , its interest rate , in the last two months, and is expected to raise it even more in the coming months.,""I just think that this is kind of the beginning of a slower market, maybe a more balanced market,"" she told CBC News in an interview. ""We're kind of at the top ... we've just started to go down a little bit [but] I just don't know how long or how low that that downward will be."",Toronto home owner Syed Azhar Shah is one would-be seller who's having to adjust their expectations down a little in the current market. Shah listed a home for sale in February, but recently took it off the market after being underwhelmed by what he was being offered.,""We had only about nine showings, and there was only one offer, which was much below what we wanted,"" Shah told CBC News.,Shah says he may consider relisting the home in a year or so, but regardless he says he's ""quite disappointed"" at the moment. ""We are not going to get the prices ... that we were getting in February,"" Shah said.,Another formerly red hot large market, Vancouver, is also showing signs of cooling. ,The average selling price in Greater Vancouver was $1.29 million in March, down slightly from $1.32 million the previous month. Prices are still up from $1.16 million a year ago, but realtor Leo Wilke with Engel & Völkers says the pace of increase is slowing. ""The escalation that was happening during COVID was just so crazy,"" he told CBC News in a recent interview. ""One guy sells for X, the next guy gets more, the next guy gets more."",""Now, what we've seen is we've kind of levelled off from that,"" Wilk said.,Robert Kavcic, an economist with Bank of Montreal, says it's too early to tell if March represents a blip or the start of a new downward trend, but he suspects the latter.,""Keep in mind that last March was the absolute summit of the pandemic demand mountain, so the reported year-over-year drop is somewhat exaggerated,"" he said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""There are signs that the appetite is pulling back amid higher mortgage rates, and the decline in March might be the first in a longer series of softening trends."""
Twitter says 'poison pill' defence makes 'coercive' takeover difficult,"Twitter's board of directors says it adopted a ""poison pill"" defence in order to protect the social media platform from ""coercive or otherwise unfair"" takeover tactics. ,The company announced the move Friday and provided more details in a regulatory filing early Monday. On Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk disclosed an offer to buy the company for $43 billion US, or $54.20 per share. He currently owns about nine per cent of Twitter shares. ,A rights agreement enacted by the board would give shareholders as of April 25 the right to buy one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock for each common share they own, at a price of $210 if any person or group of investors acquire 15 per cent or more of the company's shares without board approval, Twitter said in a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ,The preferred stock would have the same voting rights as a common share. It would give existing shareholders more votes, making it harder for an investor to take control of the company. The filing does not specifically mention Musk. ,""The effect of the agreement may be to ""render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving the company,"" the filing said.,Despite the poison pill defence, the board is still leaving open the possibility of negotiating with Musk or another suitor. The filing says the rights agreement should not interfere with any merger, offer or other business combination approved by the board.,Twitter's board hasn't formally rejected Musk's offer. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said it was interesting that Twitter first filed the shareholder rights plan before turning Musk down, but he expects the rejection to come in the next 24 to 48 hours.,""Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board,"" Musk tweeted on Thursday.,He also said: ""If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale."",Twitter said in a filing Thursday that Musk offered to buy the company for more than $43 billion. Musk said Twitter ""needs to be transformed as a private company"" in order to build trust with its users and do better at serving what he calls the ""societal imperative"" of free speech.,Musk called the offer final, although he provided no details on financing. Such details could improve his chances of buying the company. Musk likely could raise some of the money by borrowing billions using his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX as collateral.,Shares of Twitter rose nearly three per cent to $46.38 in Monday morning trading, still $7.82 shy of Musk's offer. That's a sign that investors are skeptical of whether Musk can pull off the deal. ,Musk revealed in regulatory filings over recent weeks that he'd been buying Twitter shares in almost daily batches starting Jan. 31, ending up with a stake of about nine per cent. Only Vanguard Group controls more Twitter shares. A lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York federal court alleged Musk illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices.,On Twitter Monday, Musk wrote that board members would get no pay if his offer is successful. That would save Twitter about $3 million per year, he wrote. "
This landlord bought a Toronto-area farm 2 years ago. But the tenant has barred him from the property,"A man who bought a 40-hectare farm in the Toronto area two years ago says he's still waiting to move in because a tenant is refusing to leave — and he says the body that's supposed to rule on landlord-tenant disputes has been too slow to act.,Sarbjit Sra, a real estate broker from nearby Brampton, bought the property in April of 2020. He first went to Ontario's Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) in June of that year seeking an eviction order on the grounds that he and his family want to live on the property, located about 60 kilometres northwest of Toronto. But the board didn't rule in his favour until June of 2021 and the order can't be acted upon until the LTB issues it in writing.,Almost 10 months later, Sra is still waiting for that written order.,""I can't sleep at night right now,"" he said. ""Right now, we are very frustrated."",Meanwhile, he says, he's facing expenses of about $10,000 a month to pay mortgages, taxes and utilities on the farm, which he bought for $1.75 million. He says the tenant refuses to pay rent or allow him onto the property to inspect it for damage. Organizations that represent landlords in Ontario say the situation underscores a growing problem — the LTB's seeming inability to quickly rule on these disputes and promptly evict problem tenants. ,Since that first application, an exasperated Sra has tried to speed things up by applying for two more eviction orders. In November of 2020, he filed a request on the grounds that the man hadn't been paying his rent. That was denied but the board did order the tenant to pay back rent of almost $11,000. Sra says he hasn't seen a penny of it. ,So Sra then filed for a third eviction order, also based on non-payment of rent, in June of 2021. It was heard by the board this past January, and this time, the LTB agreed — in writing — to evict the tenant. But about a month ago, Sra was notified that order had been set aside while it was reviewed at the tenant's request. ,Sra and the paralegal who represents him say it all could have been avoided if the board had only issued a written order on his original application in a timely fashion. An LTB spokesperson declined CBC Toronto's request for an interview to explain the delay, but in the past, the board has acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a backlog of cases.,""Due to shifting of staff resources, there will be a substantive delay [in] processing and scheduling some types of applications,"" a statement on the board's website reads. ""Orders will be issued between 20 to 60 days depending on the application type."",But Ajmer Singh Mandur, the paralegal representing Sra, told CBC Toronto he's rarely seen an applicant wait this long for a written order.,""I can say in my practice for the last 11 years that I have never come across such a bizarre situation,"" he said.,CBC Toronto has requested an interview with the tenant through his legal representative. So far, there has been no response.,The farm includes a barn, outbuildings and two adjacent rental units — the farmhouse and a connecting apartment. Sra says the lease calls for a monthly rent of $1,140. The LTB has calculated the tenant has racked up back rent of almost $23,000.,""Property owners who purchase a home that they wish to live in should not be made to wait for up to a year or more ... and should not be prejudiced if tenants refuse to pay the rent,"" said Rose Marie, vice-chair of an organization called the Small Ownership Landlords of Ontario.,""Rental housing providers are starting to wake up the fact that there is something seriously wrong with the system — it is broken. We look forward to changes in the near future. Not next year, now."",Marie says from 2019 to 2020, there were 41,621 eviction applications aimed at tenants who were refusing to pay their rent — resulting in losses to landlords of about $1.45 billion. The following year, due to the pandemic, the number of applications dropped to just 24,400, which translates to loss of rental income of about $856 million, Marie says.,Her organization is calling on the LTB to hold timelier, more efficient hearings.,""We need changes with the speed of light,"" she said.,""There's something broken inside that needs to be fixed,"" Mandur said. ""COVID has had its effect on these cases, but that has to do with scheduling; nothing to do with writing decisions."",On top of everything else, Sra says he's also tried to inspect the property, after giving 24 hours notice, ""six or seven times,"" but has been barred by the tenant.,""It's a nightmare for me,"" Sra says.,""I believe in our judicial system. I believe in the courts, I believe in the LTB and hopefully we will get possession one day."""

They were supposed to return to Canada by the end of the long weekend, until Demers learned their flight had been delayed.,""I just texted my boss this morning, telling him I'll be in tonight, but now I don't know,"" he said.,""The hotel has been very good to us…, "" he said. ""But it's still hot, and we want to know what happened."",By around 4:45 p.m. ET, Demers said he was on his way home.,Anne Estabrooks aid she and her children had been waiting at a Mexican airport for an hour before employees first told them the system had crashed. They were supposed to fly back to Vancouver early Monday.,""That turned into about six hours of sitting on the floor at the Mexico airport with no knowledge of what was going on whatsoever,"" she said. ,""Every time they give us an update, [they say], 'I'll tell you in an hour,'"" she said. ""That's happened six or seven times, and the information doesn't change after that hour."",Mario Marcil said he and his wife had been waiting since around 3 a.m. Monday at Toronto's Pearson International Airport to board their flight to Cuba. ,The pair bought their tickets for a Sunwing flight at 8 p.m. yesterday in the hopes of seeing Marcil's mother-in-law before she dies. ,Marcil said he'd been getting numerous calls from Cuba amid the delay asking when they would be arriving. At one point, he was told by a family member that she had only hours left to live. ,""We don't know if we're going to make it on time,"" Marcil said through tears.,Meanwhile, the airline says ""best attempts are being made"" to inform passengers of how their flights are affected and it's encouraging passengers with trips scheduled over the next day to check their flight status before heading to the airport. ,It says it is also co-ordinating hotel accommodations and airport transfers with its destination management company.,Maintaining a computer system is the airline's own responsibility, said Gábor Lukács, a passenger rights advocate. ,""There can be some truly exceptional responsibilities like being hacked like internet cables being cut accidentally, but airlines have to have contingencies,"" he said. ,When a passenger is delayed or a flight is cancelled for reasons within the carrier's control, he said, the passenger is owed not only meals, accommodation and swift transportation to their destination, but also up to , for the inconvenience. ,""If other airlines are unaffected, then Sunwing has to buy you a ticket at its own dime on other carriers' flights,"" he said.,Joaquin Chanchan, a Montrealer travelling to the Dominican Republic for a family reunion, said he's going to make sure he submits all the paperwork necessary to be reimbursed for losing a day of his trip. ,""We were going to arrive at noon, now it's at seven in the evening, so the first day of our vacation is lost,"" said Chanchan. ,""I do expect compensation for it."" ,Lukács says this is well within passengers' rights, and he urges them to be aware of airlines' lack of transparency about them. ,""You don't ask the airline about your rights, you tell them about your rights,"" he said."
"Energy transition will be challenging in era of public protests, regulatory hurdles","From carbon capture and hydrogen development to the accelerated rollout of wind and solar power and rapid electrification of transportation systems, the federal government has laid out an ambitious roadmap to get Canada to its climate target of cutting emissions by 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and net-zero emissions by 2050.,But overhauling this country's entire energy infrastructure in a short amount of time represents an unprecedented technical challenge that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, experts say.,And pessimists are quick to point out that Canada doesn't have a good recent track record when it comes to getting ambitious, expensive infrastructure projects over the finish line.,In Alberta in particular — where the ghosts of cancelled pipeline projects still haunt the public consciousness — some observers believe this country has lost the political will and spirit of national unity that's required to get big things done.,""We've spent a decade making building anything extremely difficult, if not impossible,"" said Calgary-based energy analyst, oil services sector executive and consultant David Yager.,""Canada's recent history suggests these [net-zero] targets are aspirational, to say the least."",Yager points to Enbridge Inc.'s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline, which was quashed by the federal Liberals in 2016.,In 2017, the proposed $15.7-billion Energy East project was cancelled by TransCanada after being bogged down by regulatory delays, new environmental criteria, and opposition to the line along major sections of the proposed route.,Then in 2021, TC Energy's proposed Keystone XL pipeline project was cancelled by U.S. president Joe Biden — the culmination of a decade-plus battle that had pitted the energy industry against environmentalists opposed to the project.,There are many other high-profile examples of troubled Canadian energy projects, from the Coastal GasLink pipeline — the construction of which led to rail blockades across the country by Indigenous opponents of the project and their supporters — to Pacific Northwest LNG, a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal in Prince Rupert, B.C., which was scrapped by Malaysia's Petronas and partners in 2017 in part because of concerns raised by local Indigenous groups about the project's impact on salmon spawning grounds in the area.,While the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is going ahead, the costs of that project have ballooned to $21.4 billion after being bought by the federal government for $4.5 billion in 2018.,Trans Mountain has been dogged by increased security costs, route changes to avoid culturally and environmentally sensitive areas, and scheduling delays related to permitting processes, among other issues.,Opponents of these projects say the cancellations and delays show the need to end reliance on the fossil fuel industry and move toward greener energy production.,But it isn't just oil and gas projects that are becoming increasingly difficult to build these days, Yager said. In Ontario, wind farm projects have been cancelled because they pose threats to bat populations.,In Quebec, a proposed hydro line that would have carried clean power to Massachusetts was scrapped after residents of tiny Maine refused to allow transmission through their state.,""You can't even build a cellphone tower anymore without running into opposition,"" Yager said. ""Where do you think you could put a new hydro dam nowadays? Nowhere."",Experts have suggested that Canada will have to double, perhaps even triple, the size of its electricity grid by 2050 in order to meet its net-zero goals.,That would require not just new transmission infrastructure, but interprovincial co-operation on new regional interties to help connect areas with access to clean power to areas still reliant on coal.,In addition, the federal government wants to increase Canadian production of critical minerals such as copper, aluminum and lithium in order to support a domestic supply chain for the electric vehicle industry.,The prospect is daunting, said Warren Mabee, director of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.,""All of these things have a footprint, and are going to be a challenge to implement,"" he said.,Canada isn't the only jurisdiction where large-scale infrastructure projects increasingly face regulatory and social licence challenges.,It's a similar story in the U.S. and in Europe, Mabee said, adding there's a real risk that companies in the clean energy space will default to the developing world or other jurisdictions where the rules aren't as tight and the public doesn't get as much of a say in where and how things are built.,He added he believes it's possible for Canada to advance its net-zero goals, but he said the government will need to clearly communicate what the vision is — and then have the political will to enforce it.,""The level of effort that's going to be required will be comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic response,"" Mabee said.,But Donna Kennedy-Glans, a former oil industry executive who served as Alberta's associate minister for electricity and renewable energy from 2013 to 2014, said she doesn't think projects carried out in the name of energy transition will come up against the same kind of hurdles that the oil and gas industry has faced in recent years.,She said while there are certainly people who oppose large-scale wind and solar farms, some of the biggest renewable energy projects in the world are blossoming across Alberta right now, and in general, the regulatory process has gone smoothly.,""Very few people are stepping up to try to stop this ... the people who complain are being viewed as being opposed to green energy, and that's really not a comfortable space to be in,"" Kennedy-Glans said.,She added that she believes even the large-scale expropriation of private land for new transmission lines, for example, will face relatively little political and regulatory pushback if it's carried out in the name of climate change.,""There will be a different level of political will to see that done,"" Kennedy-Glans said. ""I do think that people in affected communities will be upset by it ... but it's going to come down to a question of 'is this in the public interest and is it the right thing to do?'"""
"What you need to know this tax season, and how to plan for the next one","If you haven't filed your tax return yet, this Easter weekend might be time to check that off your to-do list. ,Canadians have until May 2 to file their taxes, thanks to the traditional deadline of April 30 falling on a Saturday. For those who are self-employed, that deadline is June 15.,But before you rush to your tax-filing platform of choice, here are a few answers to questions you may have about filing your tax return this year and how to best prepare for the next one. ,The tax deadline especially matters in the case of Canadians who owe money in taxes because filing late can come with ,. If you're expecting a net positive tax return, filing late can delay any money you're getting back. ,Andrew Bauer, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Waterloo, says the financially savvy thing to do is get your tax credit as soon as possible. ,""Our refund is an interest-free loan that you gave to the government,"" said Bauer. ""The longer you wait to get your money back, the more the opportunity cost is being wasted."",However, filing too early can also have its drawbacks. It can sometimes lead to missed information, such as an income slip or a deductible you can claim, said Bruce Ball, the vice president of taxation at the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada.,""If you realize afterwards there was other income that you didn't put on your tax return, you should go back and amend your tax return or to report it,"" said Ball. ,There aren't many changes this year to the tax system, said both tax experts. The Canadian Revenue Agency outlines on their , some of the changes to available incentives.,If you received a COVID-related support payment in 2021, you should have received a T4A by now. ,Anyone who , a COVID benefit is eligible to claim a tax deduction in the same year the repayment was made or in the year the benefit was received. ,Canadians continue to be eligible to receive a tax credit for home office expenses incurred while working from home. Using the simplified method, you can claim up to $500 this year if you worked at home for at least 50 per cent of the time over a stretch of four weeks or more. ,Residents of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are eligible this year to receive the climate action incentive payment, a credit meant to help offset the cost of federal pollution pricing. However, the payment will be disbursed in quarterly instalments this year and the amount will depend on the province of residence, marital status and the number of children in the household. ,Part of maximizing your tax return is figuring out which tax-advantaged savings account is right for you in any given year.,A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) allows you to make contributions that are tax-deductible. If you contributed $5,000 to an RRSP in 2021, for example, that amount is deducted from your total taxable income. When you decide to withdraw out of the account, that money is then taxed as income. ,Contributions to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) are not tax-deductible. However, money invested in the account can grow tax-free. ,Bauer says there are several considerations to make when deciding to invest in one account versus the other, including the time horizon for when you expect to need the money. TFSAs allow for your contribution room to be replenished after withdrawing money, whereas that's not the case with an RRSP. ,But an important deciding factor is how much you expect to pay in taxes now compared to the time at which you may withdraw money from the account. ,""Generally speaking, RRSPs probably make sense for people that are in higher tax brackets because you're getting tax deductions upfront when you put the money in,"" said Ball. ,If you're saving money for retirement and expect your income to be lower at that time, for example, you'd be saving on taxes by taking the tax deduction this year and paying a lower tax rate at the time of withdrawal. ,Some countries, like the United Kingdom, have return-free filings that avoid the process of having to ensure that you've paid your taxes by a certain date. ,""I would expect that in the next few years we'll probably get to that point,"" said Bauer, adding that the tax-filing process may become simplified for those whose income and tax deductions are reported on official slips. ,While filing taxes has been simplified greatly over the years with the digitization of tax slips, Ball says the challenge with taking it a step further and eliminating the return system is that there are a lot of different tax credits and deductions a filer can claim.,""The credits and deductions, the CRA doesn't know about them. So it's hard for them to pre-populate a return,"" he said. ,You can get ahead of each tax season by keeping records of expenses that may be eligible for a tax deduction or credit. ,And if you forget to keep track of those expenses, Ball recommends going back to the place where you made the tax-deductible payment and asking for a new receipt for the expense. ,Another way to plan ahead, according to Bauer, is to fill out a T1213 form if you're planning to make contributions to your RRSP so that your employer can deduct less income tax from your paycheque.,""That's certainly one place where planning really can make a difference,"" said Bauer.,Getting familiar with the available tax credits and deductions is also useful, said Ball, adding that the Canada Revenue Agency makes that information available on its website. ,For Canadians whose taxes aren't complicated to calculate, knowing the tax system allows you to skip on the $100 to $200 you may be paying for an accountant to file your tax return. ,""Sorry to all my accounting friends, but if you have a simple return, with a little bit of time and care, you don't need anybody else's help,"" said Bauer. "
"German businesses, unions oppose boycott of Russian oil and natural gas","Germany's employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc's largest economy.,""A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further deindustrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,"" said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the German Trade Union Confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany's dpa news agency.,The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine's leaders say revenues from Russia's energy exports are financing Moscow's destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.,That won't be easy to do.,The EU's 27 nations get around 40 per cent of their natural gas from Russia and around 25 per cent of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.,Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shutoff and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024.,The EU's executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year's end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liquefied gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.,German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that ""an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany."",Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million US per day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.,Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5 per cent."
Sunwing technical issue continues to disrupt travel plans for thousands of passengers,"Sunwing Airlines Inc. says thousands of passengers remain stranded and the start of vacations delayed for others as the company continues to struggle with a technical problem that has grounded flights.,The Toronto-based airline says about 15 out of the more than 40 scheduled flights have been processed since the technical issue first surfaced.,Sunwing says its check-in systems provider continues to experience a system outage.,It says Airline Choice is working with relevant authorities to find a solution as soon as possible and is processing flights manually, subject to airport restrictions, curfews and required crew reassignments.,Some of the planes are waiting to return to Canada, which has delayed the start of vacations for other travellers.,Sunwing apologized to passengers ""whose travel plans have been impacted"" and urged them to sign up for flight alerts on its website at Sunwing.ca.,""Our team has been working day and night to find alternate ways to get customers to their destination or on return flights home,"" it said in a news release.,The tour operator has said the problem also affected other airlines, snarling their traffic as well."
IMF downgrades outlook for global economy to 3.6% this year,"The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday downgraded the outlook for the world economy this year and next, blaming Russia's war in Ukraine for disrupting global commerce, pushing up oil prices, threatening food supplies and increasing uncertainty already heightened by the coronavirus and its variants.,The 190-country lender cut its forecast for global growth to 3.6 per cent this year, a steep falloff from 6.1 per cent last year and from the 4.4 per cent growth it had expected for 2022 back in January. It also said it expects the world economy to grow 3.6 per cent again next year, slightly slower than the 3.8 per cent it forecast in January.,Canada's economy is forecast to 3.9 per cent this year, before cooling to just 2.8 per cent in 2023.,The war — and the darkening outlook — came just as the global economy appeared to be shaking off the impact of the highly infectious Omicron variant.,""The war will slow economic growth and increase inflation,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters on Tuesday.,Now, the IMF expects Russia's economy — battered by sanctions — to shrink 8.5 per cent this year and Ukraine's 35 per cent.,U.S. economic growth is expected to drop to 3.7 per cent this year, down from four per cent previously and also down from the 5.7 per cent pace seen in 2021, which was the best year for the U.S. economy since 1984. Hobbling U.S. growth this year will be Federal Reserve interest rate increases, meant to combat resurgent inflation, and an economic slowdown in key American trading partners.,Europe, heavily dependent on Russian energy, will bear the brunt of the economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war. For the 19 countries that share the euro currency, the IMF forecasts collective growth of 2.8 per cent in 2022, down sharply from the 3.9 per cent it expected in January and from 5.3 per cent last year.,The IMF expects the growth of the Chinese economy, the world's second biggest, to decelerate to 4.4 per cent this year from 8.1 per cent in 2021. Beijing's zero-COVID strategy has meant , in bustling commercial cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen.,Some commodity-exporting countries, benefiting from the rising price of raw materials, are likely to defy the trend toward slower growth. For example, the IMF raised its growth forecast for oil producer Nigeria to 3.4 per cent this year from the 2.7 per cent the fund said it expected back in January.,The world economy had bounced back with surprising strength from 2020's brief but brutal coronavirus recession. But the rebound presented problems of its own: Caught by surprise, businesses scrambled to meet a surge in customer orders, which overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards. The result: long shipping delays and higher prices.,The IMF forecasts a 5.7 per cent jump in consumer prices in the world's advanced economies this year, the most since 1984. In the United States, inflation is running at a four-decade high.,Central banks are raising interest rates to counter rising prices, a move that could choke off economic growth. By driving up prices of oil, natural gas and other commodities, the Russia-Ukraine war has made their task of fighting inflation while preserving the economic recovery even trickier.,The conflict also has ""triggered the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II,"" the IMF noted, and cut supplies and raised prices of fertilizer and grain produced in Russia and Ukraine, threatening food security in Africa and in the Middle East. In a speech last week, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned of the threat of ""more hunger, more poverty and more social unrest."""
Heat pumps 101: Common questions about a greener option for heating and cooling your home,"More British Columbians want to install electric heat pumps as a greener way to save money long-term while heating and cooling their homes  — and one contractor says it's getting harder to keep up with demand.,""It's pretty crazy right now,"" says Joe Cheriex, owner of Controlled Air Heating and Cooling in Courtenay, B.C., on Vancouver Island. ,""You're just seeing heat pumps going in everywhere. It's not even just new residential homes. They're going into condo developments. They're going into hotels. There's just such a need for them."",Heat pumps, which use electricity and refrigerant to transfer heat from outside to inside and vice-versa, are a greener heating option than natural gas, propane or oil in a province like B.C. that relies heavily on hydroelectricity, according to Cheriex.,In warm weather, heat pumps are up to 50 per cent more energy efficient compared to a typical window AC unit, according to B.C. Hydro.,They cost an average of $8,000 and $16,000 to purchase and install, Cheriex said, although , depending on the building project and existing heat sources.,Common questions Cheriex often fields about heat pumps include cost, longevity, noise and effectiveness in cold weather. ,The lifespan of a heat pump should be in the range of 20 years, Cheriex said, while some newer units have warranties in the range of 10 to 12 years on major parts. ,While some older units may be noisy, ""the newer stuff is getting quieter and quieter, some of it as low as 50 decibels, which is basically as loud as a dishwasher."",As for cold weather, Cheriex says the cold-climate heat pump at his Vancouver Island home worked in -15 C temperatures and auxiliary heat kits are available for colder climates. ,In terms of cost, it may take a homeowner about a decade to recoup the price of a heat pump through savings from not using fossil fuels.,""But if you're getting rebates.... it's going to take a lot less of time to get your money back out of it,"" Cheriex said.,Peter Sundberg, executive director of City Green, says those interested in installing a heat pump may end up on a wait list. In the interim, he says, homeowners can focus on upgrades to insulation and windows to make their home more energy efficient."

Hundreds of homes evacuated as fast-moving wildfire tears through northern Arizona,"At least two dozen structures have been destroyed in a fast-moving wildfire in rural northern Arizona that ballooned to nearly 25 square kilometres Tuesday, Coconino County Sheriff Jim Driscoll said during a news conference.,The county declared an emergency Tuesday as winds whipped the flames, shut down a major highway and grounded aircraft that could drop water and fire retardant. County officials said 766 homes and 1,000 animals have been evacuated from the area.,A couple of hundred homes along U.S. 89, north of Flagstaff, were evacuated as embers jumped ahead of the main blaze and smoke billowed into the air in an all-too-familiar scene. Residents recalled scrambling to pack their bags and flee a dozen years ago during a much-larger wildfire burned in the same area.,Firefighters on Tuesday were up against 80 kilometre per hour gusts that pushed the wildfire over the highway and weren't expected to let up much this week, authorities said.,""It's blowing hard, and we have ash falling on the highway,"" said Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton.,About 200 firefighters were working the fire that appeared to be moving northeast away from the more heavily populated areas of Flagstaff, toward Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument and volcanic cinders, said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith.,""It's good in that it's not headed toward a very populated area, and it's headed toward less fuel,"" he said. ""But depending on the intensity of the fire, fire can still move across cinders."",A top-level national fire management team is expected to take over later this week.,Fire and law enforcement agencies that were knocking on doors to warn of evacuations Tuesday were forced to pull out to avoid getting trapped by the flames, Paxton said. Arizona Public Service Co. shut off power to about 625 customers to keep firefighters safe, a spokeswoman said.,Red flag warnings blanketed much of Arizona and New Mexico on Tuesday, indicating conditions are ripe for wildfires. Residents in northern New Mexico's Mora and San Miguel counties were warned to be ready to evacuate as wildfires burned there amid dry, warm and windy conditions.,The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that nearly 2,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel were assigned to more than a dozen large wildfires in the Southwestern, Southern and Rocky Mountain areas. Scientists say climate change has made the U.S. West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.,The fire in Flagstaff grew quickly, scorching timber and grass. It started Sunday afternoon 22 kilometres northeast of the city nestled in the largest contiguous Ponderosa pine forest in the U.S. Investigators don't know yet what caused it and have yet to corral any part of the flames.,The Arizona Department of Transportation shut down a section of U.S. 89, the main route between Flagstaff and the far northern part of the state, and a primary route to and from Navajo Nation communities, because of the wildfire. Various organizations worked to set up shelters for evacuees and for animals.,Ali Taranto rushed to Flagstaff from Winslow, where she works at a hospital, to check on a property she owns that was threatened by the wildfire. She also was getting messages to check on a neighbour whom she found didn't have access to oxygen while the power was out and didn't have the strength to manually open her garage door to evacuate.,Taranto said the neighbour was ""disoriented and gasping for air"" when she reached her. Firefighters in the area helped get the garage door open and the neighbour to the hospital, she said. Taranto was looking for a shelter for the neighbour's two dogs.,By the time Taranto left the area, the highway into Flagstaff was shut down and she had to drive an extra two hours back home. At least two other neighbours didn't evacuate their properties, she said.,""To see flames several yards away from your property line and to hear the propane tanks bursting in the background, it was very surreal,"" Taranto said. ""Ash falling down. It was crazy."",The wind is expected to be a challenge the rest of the week, along with warmer-than-average weather and low humidity, the National Weather Service said.,""I don't see any significant decreases in wind, I don't see any big bump ups in humidity and, at this point, we're not really expecting any precipitation either,"" said meteorologist Robert Rickey.,Elsewhere in Arizona, firefighters battled a wildfire in a sparsely populated area of the Prescott National Forest about 16 kilometres south of Prescott. The cause of the2.4 square-kilometre wildfire was under investigation."

He said they're trying to meet the requirements to hold a vote on whether to form a union.,""It's important to give people a voice in the work place. Their working conditions are, I can say, deplorable. Their wages are below living rates,"" Tulp said.,It's unclear if workers are trying to form unions at other Amazon warehouses in Canada.,In its release about the expansion, the company said it would provide full-time operations employees with access to educational opportunities through ""upskilling"" programs, and Amazon will pay up to 95 per cent tuition for courses related to in-demand fields.,Spokesperson Dave Bauer told CBC News in an email the vast majority of the Hamilton warehouse workers will be full time. He said the starting wage is $18.70 an hour. Workers also have medical, vision and dental coverage, and other benefits like a group RRSP plan, stock awards and performance bonuses.,Arora said in an interview Tuesday that there will also be jobs related to human resources, warehouse health and safety, and information technology.,Marco said at $18.70 per hour, workers will struggle to afford rent in Hamilton. He also said he wants more details about the benefits plan.,""The compensation numbers are at a very bare bones for a full-time position in a city as expensive as Hamilton, as is the case with many warehouse-oriented jobs. However, the quality of job rests not only in the compensation package, but also in the working conditions,"" he said.,""One cannot grow this job into a career if they burn out in a year or less."""
Controlled burn turns into uncontrolled fire southwest of Saskatoon,"A controlled burn got out of hand on Tuesday southwest of Saskatoon, destroying a trailer and possibly some vehicles, according to the Saskatoon Fire Department (SFD).,SFD received a report of the uncontrolled fire along Highway 60 south of Valley Road just before 3:00 p.m.,Upon arrival at the scene, firefighters faced a large grass fire which was moving quickly due to a strong wind blowing up to 55 km/h, said SFD.,The SFD had initially sent one fire engine, two tanker units, two brush trucks and the battalion chief to the scene, but later three additional fire engines came out to help.,Firefighters from Pike Lake and Delisle were also on scene to help put out the fire.,""SFD's fire crews prioritized protection of structures that were in the fire's path,"" said the Saskatoon Fire Department in a media release on Tuesday afternoon.,""With the wind gusts, this fire is difficult to extinguish and to get ahead of at this time."",The fire consumed a trailer and potentially some vehicles, said SFD.,Warman RCMP was also at the scene of the fire.,They initially asked the public to avoid Highway 60 as well as Valley Road near Vanscoy.,Just after 6:30 p.m. Saskatchewan RCMP shared the update that the highway was now back open.,On Monday, the Saskatoon Fire Department were called to another uncontrolled fire in the Saskatoon area.,The fire on Monday also initially started as a controlled burn, said the SFD on Monday.,A large area of grass the size of a ""football field"" was on fire south of Saskatoon on Highway 219 at the entrance to Beaver Creek, according to the SFD.,The fire was apparently not connected to Beaver Creek Conservation Area and not part of the Meewasin Prescribed Fire Program, said the Meewasin Valley Authority.,""Any fires conducted by Meewasin requires a permit through the Saskatoon Fire Department where a plan is presented which includes where, when and how the burn will be conducted, along with considered conditions,"" the authority said in a news release.,""These conditions include wind speed, wind direction, days since precipitation, fuel moisture and relative humidity among other factors. Meewasin's prescribed fires are all planned and supervised by an experienced fire boss with assistance from trained staff and volunteers. The weather conditions on April 18th would have not met Meewasin's safety criteria."""
"Sixty years of data shows more hot days, fewer frosty days in Nova Scotia","The number of hot days in Nova Scotia is rising while frost is forming less, according to research by Dalhousie University students.,Samantha Rebitt and Cambrie Levy just finished their first year in the integrated science program at Dalhousie.,The two analyzed data collected from 1960 to 2020 at eight weather stations across the province. They compared the first three decades to the next three decades to understand how the climate has changed.,""We found that the hot temperatures were becoming more frequent,"" Rebitt told CBC Radio's , on Tuesday.,There were 14 more days in the second time period when the temperature climbed above 25 C, she said.,The biggest change, Rebitt said, was that there were 15 fewer days with frost between 1990 and 2020 compared to the previous 30 years.,""That kind of shows a shift overall in the general temperatures,"" she said. ""Not only are average temperatures changing but also extreme temperatures are changing which can have implications on society, of course."",The research also measured the agricultural growing season. There was a range of differences across different weather stations from two more days to 14.5 days.,Rebbit said an increase of more than 14 days to the growing season would have both good and bad effects in Nova Scotia.,""Obviously, with a longer climate, hopefully the more crops you can produce,"" she said. ""But at the same time, this warmer climate may introduce different diseases or pests or other invasive species that could harm the crop you're hoping for."",Another factor that would affect agriculture in the province is precipitation. The changes in precipitation levels were mixed across Nova Scotia, Rebitt said. ,The research indicated stations that were showing decreases in precipitation were located further inland while stations showing increases were located closer to the coast.,""Perhaps, coastal exposure may indicate whether precipitation is increasing or decreasing,"" said Rebitt. ""We don't actually have any statistical proof for this. It's just a trend we noticed."",""Our study was really intended to look at the early signs of climate change,"" said Manuel Helbig, an assistant professor in physics and atmosphere science who was also involved in the study.,The new research was compared to two previous studies that were released two and four years ago.,""Even adding just a few more years of data already gives us a substantial change in the frequency of extreme temperatures, for example, tells us that the changes are rapidly accelerating,"" Helbig said.,He says climate change in Nova Scotia may not be as evident or threatening as it appears to be in a province like British Columbia that saw a , and , last summer."
"Even as war in Ukraine rages, we must continue to cover climate and our changing planet",".,As the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends its eighth week promising more bloodshed, destruction and instability, it can be difficult to focus on other stories.

Professors call on Western University to commit to divesting from fossil fuel industry,"A group of 150 professors and other staff at Western University in London, Ont., has written an , to the school's administration calling on it to divest of any assets from the fossil fuel industry.,""We'd really like to see the university join the growing divestment movement by disclosing and divesting its investments in the fossil fuel industry,"" said Carol Hunsberger, associate professor in the department of geography and environment. ,The fossil fuel industry is a major contributor to climate change, said Hunsberger.,""Divestment...can send a direct financial signal by withdrawing some funds from that industry,"" she said. ""It also sends a broader message that the university is not content to profit from business as usual."",As part of a growing movement, many universities across both Canada and the U.S. have pledged to divest their financial holdings from the fossil fuel industry. The list includes the University of Toronto, Concordia University, and the University of Waterloo.,""It's quite a long list now,"" said Hunsberger.,In February, Western University's Students' Council (USC) announced it would no longer invest in companies that ""explore, drill, or refine fossil fuels."" In addition, USC said it would redistribute its investment portfolio into fossil-free funds, which now account for 61 per cent of the organization's portfolio. It committed to doing that by 2025.,Hunsberger applauds the university's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on campus, pointing to the university's strategic plan. But it's not enough, she said.,""Any institution like Western that has a commitment to sustainability needs to take proportionate action, and that includes exerting whatever financial pressure it can on the fossil fuel industry and the financial institutions that support it,"" said Hunsberger.,Though the university has not committed to divesting entirely from the fossil fuel industry, it has, over time, been tracking how much of its money is invested in the sector.,""As part of Western's commitment to reduce the university's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45 per cent by 2030 and to achieve net-zero by 2050 or sooner, we are aggressively pursuing the decarbonization of Western's investment portfolio,"" said Lynn Logan, Vice-president of Operations and Finance, in a statement on Tuesday.,Logan said Western's current direct investments in the fossil fuel sector are just 0.33 per cent of it's total operating and endowment fund, down 0.10 per cent from the year before.,""Active engagement is a key component of our responsible investing approach,"" said Logan. ""If we divest and another organization acquires that investment, we've had no impact. Engaging strategically allows us to achieve greater impact."",Logan said the university is collaborating with all sectors to set meaningful climate goals. ""This is achievable as an active owner and has the greater impact toward achieving a net-zero future,"" she said. ,Logan added Western will divest of any fossil fuel company by 2030 if it has not demonstrated ""tangible progress toward realistic net-zero pathways, as these investments will not contribute to Western's long-term goals."",Hunsberger and her colleagues still want to know how much Western has actually invested in fossil fuels, not just the percentage of the total fund and they've filed a request for investment information.,""We're trying to get that list of companies that the university is invested in to get a clearer picture of where the money is invested and how much of it,"" said Hunsberger.,""Also, where research funds and donations may be coming from that could be tied to the fossil fuel industry."",Hunsberger hopes to present the group's open letter to the University's Senate and Board of Governors this spring."
Native plants finding their way to more Nova Scotia gardens this spring,"Susan Lawrence knows her plants. ,She and her partner, Robert Baldwin, own and operate Baldwin Nurseries in Upper Falmouth. Over 27 years, the nursery has grown into a two-hectare operation offering tree seedlings, shrubs, perennials, and more. ,But Baldwin Nurseries offers something not all plant sellers provide ⁠— native Nova Scotian species. ,""For me, it's exciting to see a young couple coming in, and they want to do a garden, they want a pollinator garden,"" Lawrence said. ""They want as much native as they can get."",Over the last six years, she's noticed an increase in interest for native plant species. Plants indigenous to the area now make up about 20 per cent of stock, something Lawrence said brings benefits to a home garden.,""When you have a native species, it'll be more successful, she said. ""It's already used to the climate here.,""There's going to be no problem with a harsh winter or droughts. It's already been here for so long. So, it's adaptable."",Melanie Priesnitz, a conservation horticulturist at Acadia University's Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens, has spent much of her life working with native plants. The gardens have over 250 different species, all native to the region.,""A native plant to here is one that existed prior to European settlement, and its range is the Acadian Forest,"" Priesnitz said. ,""Before European settlement, it was called the Wabanaki Forest, named by the Mi'kmaq of this whole area, which is the land of the dawn where the sun first rises."",The Wabanaki forest region includes the Maritime provinces, parts of Quebec and certain areas of the northwestern U.S.,Priesnitz said there were originally over 1,400 indigenous species in the region until colonization when around 900 non-native species were introduced.,""It really changed our ecosystem here. It changed what the Wabanaki Forest is, some of them changed for good, maybe some of them for bad — you know, bringing in some invasive hitchhikers along the way."",Priesnitz said there are many benefits to planting native species in a garden. They include insect resistance, saving water, deterring invasive species and using less pesticide and fertilizer.,""Gardening with native plants is really giving back to the land,"" Priesnitz said. ""It's providing habitat for wildlife, it's putting the right plant in the right place. It's reforesting areas, it's trying to restore pieces of land that we have changed.,""We can really make a difference to the natural world by making good, responsible choices about planting."",The botanical gardens have native plants like ostrich fern, yellow twig dogwood, mayflower and bayberry that could easily be planted in a home garden.,Lawrence also grows and sells bayberry, a plant known for its fragrance, at the nursery. They start the seeds in their propagation room where most of their native plants begin their life. After four years of growth, they're ready to be taken home and planted. ,""Bayberry is a coastal plant, mostly on the edges of beaches. So Lockeport, Chéticamp, Cape Breton, anywhere where there's a coastal area you'll probably find bayberry,"" Lawrence said.,Right now, she's gearing up for what she expects to be a busy spring planting season.,""I've had a few different jobs in my life, but this job, every single day at the end of my day, I say, 'I love my job.' I love it."""
"Remove bird feeders, bird baths to prevent avian flu spread, Manitoba wildlife centre asks","A Manitoba wildlife rehabilitation centre is taking a number of precautions to stop the spread of the highly contagious and deadly avian influenza, and is calling on people to do their part,The Wildlife Haven Rehabilitation Centre in Île des Chênes, Manitoba, is temporarily not accepting certain birds as patients that are proven to be most susceptible to the bird flu.,While the province is considered to be in an outbreak, Canadian Wildlife Services says any bird admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres must quarantine for 30 days. ,That puts a great deal of strain on the small facility, said Zoe Nakata, the executive director of the centre.,Even so, staff are taking the guidance seriously because this strain of bird flu is impacting wild birds more so than any other, she said, and kills roughly 90 per cent of birds infected.,""We're really in uncharted territory at the moment and that's what makes us, obviously, very nervous. And we're really on the front lines here,"" Nakata said.,The wildlife centre is also calling on Manitobans to do their part.,Out of an abundance of caution, Nakata and the Wildlife Haven are suggesting people remove their bird feeders and bird baths as a way to protect all birds.,""It is to just help manage and decrease the amount of artificial gatherings that humans are creating for birds. Any time the birds are gathering, we're creating opportunity for the virus to spread,"" she said.,A spokesperson from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says backyard bird feeders and baths should be periodically cleaned.,But poultry producers and owners of small flocks or pet birds that have access to the outdoors should remove bird feeders from areas that are open to their birds to prevent contact with wild animals.,CFIA is investigating , at poultry farms across Canada. Cases have also been detected in the U.S., directly south of Manitoba.,Manitoba Conservation is investigating two suspected cases of the virus. The first was identified in snow geese that died in southwestern Manitoba, while the second was a bald eagle in the Dauphin area that was observed with neurologic signs and humanely euthanized, says a Thursday ,The eagle was at one point in the care of the Wildlife Haven.,The risk of avian flu to human health is low, and there are no known cases of transmission of this strain of the virus, called H5N1, from birds to humans in North America, the province said in a news release.,Manitobans are asked to contact the province at 1-800-782-0076 if they find clusters of dead waterfowl, ravens, crows, gulls, or any large group of dead birds, and not to touch them.,The province is also advising poultry farmers to keep their birds indoors during the wild bird migration."
Hardheaded woodpecker bores holes in world's largest hockey stick,"A Vancouver Island landmark is getting some unwanted attention from a woodpecker.,A northern flicker is hard at work drilling holes in the world's largest hockey stick in Duncan, B.C. ,Lori Iannidinardo, chair of the Cowichan Valley Regional District, said staff spotted the bird on April 7 and soon tried to determine if there was a nest. ,""They put a patch over the hole and the woodpecker came back and pecked another one,"" Iannidinardo said. ""... So now we have two holes in the stick."",The stick, which is 62 metres long and weighs 28,000 kilograms, was originally built for Expo 86 in Vancouver before arriving at the Cowichan Community Centre along with a giant puck. Iannidinardo describes it as an important community asset.  ,""We don't want to have it full of holes filling up with water, but we think that the northern flicker is winning this one,"" she said.,Crews put up a plastic owl to scare the bird away. The bird was having none of it. ,Iannidinardo said it is mating season and the woodpecker may be looking to attract a mate. , ""Hopefully he will find his mate and maybe move on without too many holes in our hockey stick,"" she said. ,And if the hardheaded bird decides to stick around? ,""We'll have to be doing a whole lot of patching."""
Illegal Canadian trash keeps ending up overseas. And the federal government won't say who's shipping it,"The federal government has privately sanctioned several Canadian recycling companies for shipping illegal, unsorted household trash to developing countries, but is keeping the list of names of those caught violating environmental and international laws secret from the public.,A ,investigation has found that at least 123 shipping containers have been returned to Canada in the past five years after foreign authorities discovered numerous violations of international waste export regulations aimed at stopping Western countries from dumping their trash in developing countries.,""We can't make those names public,"" Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said in an interview with ,.,Guilbeault said the only time names would be made public is when a company or executive was charged under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.,Environment Canada told , that in the past five years it issued nine warning letters against companies involved in the shipping of the illegal waste.,In that time, there have also been six fines totalling less than $9,000 against four companies and two individuals. ,, environmental officers may avoid laying charges if they decide a fine or a warning is ""sufficient and appropriate"" to address a company that has violated the law.,Guilbeault said that because his officials only laid fines, he agrees with Environment Canada's decision not to release the names. ,""We can issue fines, but in terms of communicating this information publicly, there is still in our legal system this provision that you're innocent until proven guilty by a court of law,"" Guilbeault said.,Marc De Strooper, a Belgian port inspector, told , and , that throughout his 25-year career, he has repeatedly caught recycling shipments containing illegal trash from Canada. De Strooper inspects shipping containers passing through the port of Antwerp on the way to their final destinations in India and other countries in Asia. ,As recently as January, he caught five illegal recycling shipments coming from Canada that were destined for developing countries.,De Strooper said he believes Canadian companies send their trash to developing countries because it can be cheaper to send it overseas rather than process recycled paper and plastics back home.,For that reason, De Strooper said governments should be more vigilant in preventing the exports of contaminated recycling products.,""I don't know how [Canadian authorities] do these inspections, or how much inspection they do on these items. I still see this waste coming to the port of Antwerp,"" De Strooper said. ,""If Canada does not change this policy or its habits around this, it will continue."",Environmental lawyer Sabaa Khan said that Canadians have a right to know the names of the companies sanctioned by the federal government — and that lifting the secrecy around illegal shipments could help prevent future violations.,""If there's no transparency, there can't be any accountability either. That's the most frustrating part,"" said Khan, who works on these issues with the David Suzuki Foundation.,""The Canadian government has decided that it won't monitor plastic waste very closely."",Under Canadian law, companies are allowed to export some recycling materials like paper or metals for processing. But DeStrooper and others have found that too often shipments for paper recycling, for example, are mixed with household trash or unrecyclable plastic.,As for those illegal shipments from Canada caught recently in Belgium, De Strooper said that the manifests stated that the trash came from companies operating out of Montreal, Toronto and Calgary.,For young environmentalists and recyclers like sisters , and , in Calgary, the lack of transparency helps protect companies — and prevents Canadians from addressing the issue in public.,""If people knew this was happening and there was more transparency … then I think real change can happen,"" Sadie, 16, said.,""I just feel kind of lied to, personally,"" Willa, 14, said. ""So why are they showing us these videos in school about what is supposed to happen after you recycle something, and it just being a myth?"",Through confidential sources, , was able to identify the source of some of the containers that Belgian authorities say were being illegally shipped abroad. The paper waste came from one of the City of Montreal's recycling centres, operated by the company Ricova International. According to the inspectors, the paper recycling shipment destined for India contained far too much additional plastic and other waste.,Ricova disputes the findings of the Belgian inspector and said that the non-paper waste in the shipment was not out of the ordinary.,Young activists and governments around the world have been pushing for a blanket ban on Western waste exports to developing countries.,In Indonesia, 14-year-old environmentalist Nina Azzahra has developed a large following on social media after her push to try to convince to Western countries to stop shipping waste to her country. ,Representatives from several countries, including Germany, , and the Netherlands, met with her and promised to change their export policies.,Since 2020, Nina has sent two letters to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.,""Why do you send your trash to our country? You should take care of your own trash in your own country,"" she wrote.,Trudeau's office responded to Nina in January, nearly two years after her first letter, and said they forwarded her letter to the environment minister. ,However, Guilbeault has yet to respond.,""They know that recycling is hard, it's difficult and expensive. Maybe they still don't want to leave Indonesia. They still want Indonesia to be a dump site for their waste,"" Nina said in an interview with ,.,""I really want you to stop — stop exporting your plastic waste to Indonesia. Just stop."",Scot Davidson, a Conservative member of Parliament for York-Simcoe, north of Toronto, has been pushing to ban the export of Canadian non-recyclable plastic waste. ,""Canada has to take responsibility,"" Davidson said. ""We just can't lob our garbage over the fence to our neighbours and say, 'Out of sight, out of mind.'"",Last year, his bill to ban the export of non-recyclable plastic waste got widespread support from opposition parties. But the Liberals wouldn't back it. ,""I hate to be partisan, but sometimes, you have to be. This is all talk, no action. The Liberals proclaim to be the party of the environment,"" Davidson said.,""It was almost like they didn't want the Conservatives to have a win on the environment, so we're not going to vote for this bill."",Guilbeault told , he disagrees with Davidson's characterization of why the Liberals voted against his bill. He said the government is focused on banning some types of single-use plastic substances to cut down on the amount of plastic Canada is producing overall. ,""We're banning plastic substances in Canada,"" Guilbeault said. ""This idea that because we didn't vote in favour of that bill, we're not – we don't want to tackle the problem is simply not true."",Despite Liberal opposition, Bill C-204 passed in the House of Commons. However, it died in the Senate along with other proposed legislation because the 2021 election was called.,""Unfortunately I think the world's oceans are going to suffer because of that delay now,"" Davidson said.,The proposed changes have been reintroduced in a new Senate bill in a second effort to have them become law.,Khan, the environmental lawyer, said that Canada has faced repeated requests from other countries to end waste shipments and join international agreements, but has delayed doing so.,""We live in one of the most technologically advanced, richest societies,"" she said. ""There's no reason that we should be exporting our wastes."",In recent years, countries in Asia in particular have been pushing back against waste coming from the West.,In 2019, 187 countries signed onto an amendment to an international treaty known as the Basel Convention. The amendment applied new regulations for the shipment of plastic waste. Canada eventually signed on, but only after two years of delays.,To this day, Canada has not signed onto another Basel amendment, one that would answer the demands of environmentalists like Nina in Indonesia.,More than 100 countries have signed onto the new amendment that would ban many waste exports to the developing world completely.,""At the end of the day, this is simply a lack of political will on Canada's part,"" Khan said.,""The European Union, for instance, has adopted the Basel ban.... Canada has adamantly refused to do so."",Guilbeault said there are ""a number of reasons"" why Canada has not yet signed. He said one of the reasons was that his government is assessing Canadian laws and enforcement tools and is considering tougher penalties for illegal exports.,He also said the Liberals' plan to ban some types of single-use plastics, ,, will cut down on the amount of plastic produced in this country.,""We need to do better,"" Guilbeault said. ""We're banning a certain number of plastic substances in Canada. It's about managing waste in Canada."",As for Nina, she is still waiting for a promise from Canada to stop exporting non-recyclable waste to Indonesia. She continues to educate people around the world, recently travelling to the Netherlands to give a speech to environmentalists there.,""As children, we have the right to live in a safe, clean and healthy environment,"" Nina told the crowd.,""The present generation should not steal our basic rights and endanger the lives of the next generation."""
"'Wow, what is that huge bird?' Sandhill crane spotted on Tantramar Marsh","Earlier this month, amateur wildlife photographer Nick Landry felt as if he was snapping photos in the Serengeti. ,In reality, he'd spent several hours quietly working his way through the yellowed grasses of the Tantramar Marsh, near the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia border. ,His efforts paid off and he was rewarded with several shots of a recent resident of the area: sandhill cranes. ,""They're almost like nothing you've seen before,"" said Landry. ""It almost felt like you were in Africa because they look ... almost like an ostrich."" ,At nearly 1.3 metres tall, sandhill cranes are contenders for the biggest bird in the province. ,Their slate-grey colouring looks blazing white against the dead marsh grasses of April. ,Landry, 20, says with their blood-red foreheads, they're surreal to encounter. ,""Very different,"" said Landry. ""Very different from anything I've seen."" ,The cranes are a rare sight in New Brunswick, not because they're rare, but because they're not supposed to be here. ,Sandhill cranes are most commonly found around the Prairies and mid-western United States, although there are breeding populations in Ontario, according to Gary Donaldson, the Atlantic manager of protected areas and stewardship for the Canadian Wildlife Service. ,""If you look at the concentration of the species, they're really kind of a mid-continent bird,"" said Donaldson. ""The Prairies are the place that you're most likely to see them."" ,Donaldson says sandhill cranes have only been reported in the marsh in recent years, but he believes they are breeding here. ,""It's something new, but regular, I would say now,"" said Donaldson. ,He's not sure when the cranes started to frequent the marshes and fields near Jolicure, N.B.. He says it may be that they've been coming to the area sometime in the last 20 years, but no one noticed them until a few years ago, when their presence was first recorded. ,He has a few theories about how they came to the Tantramar Marsh area. ,""There's all sort of reasons birds show up in crazy places and if you're an animal with wings it's pretty common for you to go places because it's so easy to go places,"" said Donaldson. ""But certainly, getting blown around by storms is one reason birds disperse into different places."" ,Donaldson notes they may also just be here as a natural expansion of their territory. He says the eastern-most populations of sandhill cranes are doing quite well, so their presence in New Brunswick may just be an example of a ""founder"" population splintering off from their traditional habitat. ,He says he fully understands why birders like Landry are drawn to them. He still finds them breathtaking. "
"14 flood-damaged homes are going to auction in High River, Alta.","Fourteen homes in High River, Alta., that have stood empty for the past nine years are finally heading to auction.,The rural town south of Calgary was flooded when the Highwood River burst its banks in June 2013, during the ,, submerging roads and homes and forcing evacuations.,The houses and duplexes in Riverside Drive and High View Park were initially bought out as part of the provincial government's flood relocation program and have sat empty ever since. They weren't badly damaged, with most having only flooded basements.,Last year, they were purchased by the Town of High River so they could be sold and inhabited again.,The first round of sealed bid auctions started this week. An open house on Tuesday attracted more than 100 people interested in taking a closer look.,""House prices are so high right now, so we're thinking it might be a better opportunity to get a house that needs a little work and put in some TLC,"" said Alicia Hale, who was checking out a house on Riverside Drive.,Cars have been cruising by all week.,""The upstairs are normal, just dated, but the basements are nothing, it's just the studs, so you'd need to put a full basement renovation in,"" said Hale.,""They're all safe and the town got them up to the standard needed to sell them,"" Hale added.,As well as potential buyers, neighbours keen to take a look inside and even the home's former owner toured the first house to be auctioned.,The sale of the homes offers some closure for the town and its residents. The town's mayor says the auction ties up one of the last loose ends left after the 2013 flood.,""These homes got stuck in purgatory,"" said Mayor Craig Snodgrass.,Snodgrass says $300 million in flood mitigation is now in place to prevent future floods, and the homes are situated in great neighbourhoods.,""We really wanted to make sure to save the homes that have now been protected and that were minimally impacted by the flood. We want to get people living back in these properties,"" said Snodgrass.,""We purchased them all from the province, and now we'll be selling them back to private ownership. We got it done, finally, nine years later,"" he said.,""All of us worked our butts off in this town to be able to look back and see what we accomplished, and where we're at today needs to be celebrated, I think,"" Snodgrass added.,Anyone can bid on a home, or even multiple homes, from young families to developers and property flippers.,The process involves a sealed bid auction.

Bear with me: Sask. bears are waking up to a chilly spring,"After resting throughout the whole winter, the two grizzly bears at the Saskatoon Forestry Farm Park & Zoo just recently woke up from their slumber.,But with temperatures around –9 C and a cold wind blowing through the zoo, the animals didn't seem too keen on leaving their cozy inside area last Wednesday, despite having already been awake for approximately two weeks. ,Only two boxes filled with treats and hay convinced the two grizzlies — called Koda and Mistaya — to poke their noses outside.,""I don't think they really regret waking up,"" said Jeff Mitchell, manager of the Saskatoon Forestry Farm Park and Zoo, with a laugh.,""They are a little groggy when they first get up for the first few days, but then they start to get a little more active."",Instead of full hibernation, bears like the Saskatoon grizzlies go into what is called torpor, explained Mitchell.,While some bears might still wake up during that time and move around a little, Koda and Mistaya seemed to be happy staying asleep for the most part during the cold season, he added.,""We have cameras in there and we monitor them all winter long,"" said Mitchell.,""The very first day Koda went outside, just stuck his head in the snow, turned around and walked back in and fell right back asleep."",That behaviour is not dissimilar to what a bear might do in the wild, according to Philip McLoughlin, associate professor at the biology department of the University of Saskatchewan.,He has seen bears in nature poke their heads out of their dens, look around and go right back to sleep for a couple more weeks.,""There are those signals of spring that will enter into the den,"" said McLoughlin.,""Some of these dens can actually get very wet inside as the snow melts."",Another term to describe the bears' period of rest during winter is dormancy, according to McLoughlin.,While the body temperature of some mammals during full hibernation might drop down to just above freezing, the bears' body temperature only decreases slightly, he said.,""But they will undergo a really deep sleep,"" added McLoughlin.,""We can tell that by their heart rate, which will accompany this drop in body temperature."",After five months of resting, the two zoo animals lost between 50 and 75 kilograms each, said Mitchell.,Now they slowly start to regain some of their weight to get ready for the next winter.,Like bears in the wild, Koda and Mistaya didn't need an alarm clock to wake up this spring.,""They tell us when they're ready to bed down for the winter,"" said Mitchell.,""And they tell us when they're ready to come back out."",The two grizzlies are not the only bears in the province that are now waking up.,Black bears in Saskatchewan are waking up ""a little bit later the further north that you get,"" said McLoughlin.,""But most of the bears are up starting now, the males first and then followed by the females and their cubs."",Black bears are quite common in Saskatchewan, especially in the northern part of the province. The females give birth to their young in the dens while they rest, explained McLoughlin.,The mothers and their cubs then have a short but intense active season during which they need to pack on all the weight they need to get through the next winter, he added.,While not actual brothers, the former orphaned cubs Koda and Mistaya have been together for about 15 years, moving to their home at the Saskatoon Forestry Farm Park & Zoo in 2008.,Like human siblings, the two usually get along, but they also fight.,Sharing food with his brother is not always one of Koda's favourite things, particularly when Mistaya tries to steal Koda's treats right under his nose.,""Mistaya always wins when it comes to food,"" said Mitchell. ""There's no question about that."""
Ukrainian environmentalists tracking possible Russian eco crimes,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shattered millions of lives, but environmental activists also worry the ecological damage to their country will be irreversible.,""It's actually a huge risk for the whole world,"" said Evgenia Zasiadko who heads up the environmental crimes team at Kyiv-based EcoAction, a non-governmental organization that pushes for green policy in Ukraine.,Zasiadko has escaped Ukraine, finding a route from Kharkiv to safety in a country she is not disclosing due to security concerns after enduring days of heavy shelling and airstrikes.,She's keeping watch from a distance, determined to hold Russia accountable for environmental damage in Ukraine.,From her temporary home, she and a network of 15 scattered across Eastern Europe are keeping close tabs on what they say are environmental crimes committed by Russia, which they are defining as anything that causes serious pollution and harm to the ecosystem and people.,So far they've logged 144 alleged environmental crimes using open-source intelligence, verified video and witness reports. Zasiadko says in Eastern Ukraine she expects there are many more incidents not yet on their radar.,For example, Zasiadko pointed to numerous videos and pictures collected by the investigators of fuel repositories belching black plumes of smoke into the air after allegedly being hit by missiles or set on fire.,""It's damage to industrial buildings. It's energy safety and nuclear safety. It's damage to ecosystems and damage to the marine ecosystem because there have been a few ships that have been bombed,"" she said.,Propellants, explosives and heavy metals used in weapons contain many contaminants including some carcinogenic compounds which can scatter in the air and leach into soil and water with serious environmental impacts, according to a , from Defence Research and Development Canada. ,""We collect the numbers of tanks, the numbers of bombs and everything that is coming to Ukraine from military actions,"" she said.,The sheer number of possible military contaminants and environmental repercussions is another one of the reasons Zasiadko says Ukraine needs the war to end as quickly as possible, and not just for her country's sake but for neighbouring Russia as well.,""Do they have enough understanding what kind of harm it could bring not only to Ukraine, but to Russia also?"" she said.,Zasiadko fears the environmental impacts of the war will displace a second wave of refugees in Ukraine due to contaminated soil and water.,""The territory would not be possible to live, to use their water, to grow any plants or vegetables because it would be a high risk for their health in the long term,"" she said.,Soil contamination from munitions can persist for decades, according to the ,. Little published information exists because of restrictions on military information, the organization notes, but it has been documented in parts of Scotland and Germany. ,Even if EcoAction has the evidence, it would be hard to hold Russia to account, said Doug Weir, research and policy director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory.,""There are very few precedents where states have been held accountable for environmental damage caused and conflict,"" Weir said from his home in West Yorkshire, England.,""The most famous one is the UN Compensation Commission, which was established after the 1991 Gulf War, but circumstances were quite unusual and quite specific in that Iraq had caused a lot of damage by setting fire to oil wells in Kuwait."",The UN Security Council set up a compensation claims commission, of which environmental claims were one small part, Weir said.  The UN was able to enforce some compensation because Iraq wasn't on the Security Council and didn't have veto power.,""Could you replicate something like that in the case of Ukraine at the moment? Probably not through the same pathway with Russia as a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power,"" said Weir. ,""But there are other potential avenues for setting up an independent tribunal, which would probably look at reparations across a whole range of damage that have been caused by Russia."",Weir worries some of the damage from the toxicity of weapons in Ukraine could be permanent but he's also concerned about what they could be unleashing when they hit their targets.,""Maybe substances like asbestos … and all of this ground up into particulate matter, which we know the PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] for example, is very bad for public health,"" he said.,""We know that there are potentially a lot of environmental contaminants which could be affecting people in these areas."",At the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Waterloo, Ont., PhD candidate Tamara Lorincz worries about the impacts of Canada's contribution to the conflict, including the munitions it has provided to Ukraine.,""All of the weapons that Canada is sending to Ukraine have adverse environmental impacts,"" she said.,There is also the carbon footprint of war machines to consider, Lorincz said.,""Fighter jets, warships, tanks, consume an exorbitant amount of petroleum products and release carbon emissions into the atmosphere,"" she said. ""War makes global warming worse."",Military emissions are excluded from most national greenhouse reduction plans, Lorincz said.,""They're huge, heavy vehicles that have very limited range. And they are energy inefficient. They consume excessive amounts of diesel. And again, they contaminate the soil and they release carbon emissions that make climate change worse,"" she said.,In a statement to CBC News, the Department of National Defence says it is ""working on transitioning  to net-zero carbon and climate-resilient operations, while also reducing environmental impacts beyond carbon, including on waste, water and biodiversity.""  ,It says it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 38 per cent compared to 2005 levels through its , — but that figure does not include the military's ""national safety and security fleets,"" among them large emitters such as aircraft and vessels. ,Rather than supply weapons to Ukraine, Lorincz would rather see Canada help monitor the ecological fallout of the war and rebuild.,""Ensure that post-conflict reconstruction and recovery is done in an environmentally and green way. So, you know, we could be working with Ukraine, for instance, afterwards to rebuild it with green principles in mind and in an energy efficient way,"" she said.,Lorincz believes the conflict couldn't have come at a worse time for the environment and has put international cooperation on climate change in peril.,""We need to cooperate with all countries like Russia and China on dealing with global warming and war undermines our ability to work well with other countries,"" she said, noting that Russia itself is in the throes of a serious climate crisis with forest fires, drought and extreme heat waves.,""I'm very concerned that this Russian invasion in Ukraine, this ongoing war, is going to increase tensions among countries and make it more difficult for us to to cooperate and come to global solutions that we need on dealing with the climate crisis."", "
Spring brings big honkin' mess of Canada geese — and calls for smarter population control,"At this time of year, you can count on two things in Vancouver: branches drooping with cherry blossoms — and urban parks filled with honking Canada geese, leaving trails of droppings as they waddle about.,Ah, spring. ,By day's end, one gander — pooping every 10 to 20 minutes — can produce a pile of feces as heavy as a cabbage.,But Vancouver is just one city grappling with the controversial headache of how to manage growing populations of the protected bird.,Conservationists would prefer people give the birds space to nest, make the landscape less attractive to them or consider giving them birth control. Meanwhile, wildlife technicians use a variety of techniques, from egg switching to scaring the birds with predators, to deal with the messy gaggles gathering in populated spots.,""Geese are everywhere in this city,"" said Dana McDonald, environmental stewardship co-ordinator, for Vancouver's board of parks and recreation.,And sometimes there are conflicts.,""If provoked or chased Canada geese can bite, especially now when they are defending their nests,"" said McDonald.,About seven million Canada geese inhabit North America, with some 4.5 million in Canada, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada,Each year, the federal government approves hundreds of permits for culling and using predators to scare away the geese. Up to a million birds are also harvested each year, which requires a hunting permit.,Despite this, Vancouver's Canada goose population is teeming. The geese were reintroduced in the 1970s, after years of overhunting. Many of the ""resident geese"" don't migrate far and so they get well-fed, despite $500 city fines for wildlife feeding.,Vancouver's urban geese gobble grass seed, damage irrigation systems and defecate on memorial benches.,So, wildlife technicians switch out viable goose eggs for frozen duds — a process called egg addling.,Hoping to target eggs this April, the Vancouver parks board began asking people to report any nests they find, which can often be spotted around nearby homes or even on roofs.,A female goose can lay several clutches a season, each containing an average of eight eggs. At that rate, even with gosling predation, Metro Vancouver expects to be dealing with 6,000 urban geese by 2025 — double what it has right now. ,Park staff, wearing protective gear, empty at least a few hundred nests each year.,The method is, under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act and supported by the B.C. SPCA and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), according to the city.,In Ontario, nests are often destroyed and predators are used to scare geese away. In 2021, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority relocated 3,163 geese.,""They are a very stubborn species. We tend to be very respectful of species such as the Canada geese, because it's our namesake and they are kind of regal and pretty,"" said Dan Frankian owner of Hawkeye Bird and Animal Wildlife Control and Removal in North York, Ont.,Frankian has spent three decades removing unwanted wildlife.,He is paid by thousands of clients to keep properties — from golf courses to airports — goose-free. The management of Canada geese management makes up about one third of his $8-million annual wildlife removal contracts.,Frankian uses Labrador retrievers, hawks, eagles and even laser lights that mimic predator shapes to scare away geese that he believes number close to 250,000 in Ontario's Golden Horseshoe area.,""They will fly up at you and literally hit you with their elbows and wings. They will beat their wings on top of you and peck you,"" he said. ""It will hurt — it's like being hit with a hockey stick but not at full swing."",Wildlife conservationists say many of the efforts to scare or kill Canada's iconic bird — even when ""humane"" methods are used — do not work long-term.,""We could not possibly addle or oil enough eggs to really make a difference in the population,"" said Liz White, president of the Animal Alliance of Canada and Leader of the Animal Protection Party of Canada.,She said that a better plan is laid out in the ,funded in part by the Animal Alliance of Canada.,White said she believes that naturalizing landscapes is a more effective long-term solution to deter geese.,I would hope that people would be able to learn to share habitat with wildlife,"" she said.,In Vernon, B.C., meanwhile, the city has been trying to get approvals and a contractor in place to kill about 150 geese that are leaving a mess on the turf at waterfront parks. The paperwork has been delayed by the pandemic — and plagued by petitions against it.,The plan is to kill the birds that lead their flocks to Kin, Paddlewheel and Polson parks, where city officials say the repeated turf clean-up costs are too high.,But White said ""culling doesn't work"" and suggested the city would be better off planting low shrubs or high grasses along waterfronts.,""It's really about blocking the vision from the water to the grass, so that the birds cannot see far enough to know that there are no predators,"" she said of the effect of naturalizing landscapes.,Geese just need space to nest in spring and moult in summer. As for egg addling, she does not agree with switching eggs once they float, which means a chick is inside.,In Victoria, B.C., political ecologist and urban biodiversity planner Jennifer Rae Pierce says Canada geese like fresh-mown grass that slopes to a waterfront — and that means humans often end up sharing the same space as the birds.,She suggests using that to our advantage. ,Given the joy people get from feeding birds, she said cities should install dispensers of goose food — but lace it with birth control.,Sort of like ""killing two birds"" with one nutritionally-appropriate pellet, she said.  ""They go where they like to go."""
'Micronova' star explosion spotted for 1st time,"Astronomers have detected a previously unknown type of stellar explosion called a micronova involving thermonuclear blasts at the polar regions of a type of burned-out star called a white dwarf after it has siphoned material from a companion star.,The researchers said on Wednesday a micronova is by far the least powerful type of star explosion now known — less energetic than a blast called a nova, in which a white dwarf's entire surface blows up, and tiny compared to a supernova that occurs during the death throes of some giant stars.,Micronovae are observed from Earth as bursts of light lasting about 10 hours. They were documented on three white dwarfs — one 1,680 light years away from Earth, one 3,720 light years away and one 4,900 light years away. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion kilometres.,""The discovery was an unexpected surprise. It goes to show just how dynamic the universe is. These events are fast and sporadic. Finding them requires looking at the right place at the right time,"" said astronomer Simone Scaringi of Durham University in England, lead author of the ,.,Did you just hear the word ""micronovae"" and get curious about what they are? We got you covered!

They have the mass of our sun but are about the size of Earth in diameter. Most stars, including the sun, are destined to end their existence in this form.,Some white dwarfs are part of what is called a binary system, in an orbit with another star.,Micronovae happen in very specific binary systems — with a white dwarf star possessing a strong magnetic field and a low-mass normal star. The white dwarf's gravitational pull can strip hydrogen gas from the companion star's surface. The hydrogen then flows toward the white dwarf's magnetic poles, similar to how Earth's magnetic field channels the solar wind to our planet's magnetic poles, causing the auroras.,At the base of accumulating columns of gas at the white dwarf's poles, pressure and temperature rise, causing thermonuclear fusion that converts hydrogen into helium.,""Under the conditions in which this is triggered, this fusion is explosive, and the micronova occurs: a thermonuclear 'bomb' goes off,"" said astronomer and study co-author Paul Groot, who divides his time between Radboud University in the Netherlands and the University of Cape Town and South African Astronomical Observatory.,1/ Using our Very Large Telescope, astronomers have discovered a new phenomenon: micronovae — stellar explosions lasting only a few hours. <br><br>Full story: 🔗 <a href=""https://t.co/i8LVpIDpmY"">https://t.co/i8LVpIDpmY</a><br><br>Details 👇 <br><br>Credit: <a href=""https://twitter.com/ESO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@ESO</a> / M. Kornmesser L. Calçada <a href=""https://t.co/SOIYXnxpxJ"">pic.twitter.com/SOIYXnxpxJ</a>,The explosion is localized and does not destroy the white dwarf. In fact, the micronova cycle can repeat itself.,""Only a very small percentage of the white dwarf participates in this explosion, roughly about one millionth of the surface area. Translated to the Earth this would be an area of about, say, the city of London,"" Groot said.,Each micronova event burns through material the equivalent of one large asteroid, or just over one millionth of Earth's mass, Scaringi said.,A micronova is similar to a nova, a thermonuclear explosion engulfing a white dwarf's entire surface. With novae, the white dwarf lacks a strong magnetic field, meaning that hydrogen stolen from the companion star is distributed globally rather than concentrating at the poles. Novae can last for weeks or months, burning through about a million times more mass than micronovae, Scaringi said.,The researchers discovered the micronovae when analyzing data from NASA's TESS space telescope. They used the European Southern Observatory's Chile-based Very Large Telescope to confirm the explosions involved white dwarfs.,Some other types of stellar explosions include: a kilonova, when two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole merge; a hypernova, a kind of supernova involving a massive star exploding at end of its life cycle and collapsing to form a black hole; and a luminous red nova involving two stars merging."
Canadians need to do more to prep for 'potentially lethal' extreme heat events: report,"The authors of a new report on extreme heat say Canada has reached the ""ultimate code red"" when it comes to addressing this burning environmental issue.,Researchers from the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo in Ontario consulted 60 experts across the country for the report, which includes ""practical actions"" individuals and communities can take to address rising temperatures.,Extreme heat is when the temperature and humidity rise above what is considered normal for an area. In some cases, the researchers say, it can be deadly.,Blair Feltmate, one of the lead authors of the report, noted that Ontario's Waterloo region currently sees about 10 to 12 days each summer where temperatures reach 30 C or higher, often topping out at 34 C.,He said modelling shows that by 2050, there could be up to 55 days each summer above 30 C and it could top out at 38 C.,People tend to equate extreme weather with floods or fires, Feltmate said. During those events, there can be human death, but in extreme cases of heat, hundreds can die. That was the case when , during a ""heat dome"" over parts of British Columbia, which saw temperatures above 40 C from late June to early July in 2021.,""So we describe it as a code red, because extreme heat is almost like the silent killer — that when things go wrong, they really go wrong,"" Feltmate said.,The report mentions three hot spots in Canada that are expected to be particularly impacted by extreme heat:,These are areas that have, in the past, seen more summer days over 30 C, higher maximum temperatures and longer heat waves than other parts of the country.,But the report says everyone is at risk from heat illnesses when temperatures rise.,Joanna Eyquem, another lead author of the study, said a lot of deaths from extreme heat involve people who live alone. Those most likely to be impacted are the elderly, people experiencing homelessness and people with health conditions.,""Because it's something that affects everybody, and we don't know when there is a problem necessarily, unless we're checking on those people, it might be harder to get away from extreme heat,"" Eyquem said.,""Basically, cities are hot spots for extreme heat and for global warming. So if you live in a city, you're probably exposed."",In April, a Statistics Canada report found many cities are going grey rather than green, which can result in urban heat island effects — when an urban area is significantly warmer than surrounding areas, such as a parking lot compared to a park. ,The federal agency's report looked at the greenness of 996 areas in 2001, 2011 and 2019. Of the 31 cities involved, two in Ontario, ,, saw more green in 2019 than in 2011 and 2001, while St. John's maintained the same level of greenness over the 18 years.,Niall Lobley, director of parks and cemeteries for the City of Kitchener, said council has ""shown a strong commitment"" to greenspaces in recent years.,Urban green spaces play a key a role in a city's ecosystem, by mitigating floods, Lobley said, and keeping the city cool during hot summer days.,Feltmate said that beyond planting trees, there are other initiatives cities could undertake, such as painting roofs white.,""When sunlight hits the white surface, that energy re-radiates back to space rather than staying on the ground. And we want cool pavements, lighter-coloured pavements, again, to reflect sunlight, the heat from sunlight back up into space,"" he said.,Eyquem said individuals can also use nature to help cool off their spaces: ""Looking at trees and vegetation, using them to shade our homes and buildings, and basically these surfaces cool our cities."",Some tips in the report include:,""We need to act at different levels. But we also look at different types of actions,"" Eyquem said.,Gideon Forman is a Toronto-based climate policy analyst for the David Suzuki Foundation.,The foundation was not one of the consultants on the University of Waterloo report, although its Butterfly Way Project was highlighted as an initiative that brought more vegetation into urban areas.,Forman said the report highlights that temperatures have already, in some parts of Canada, ""defied belief."",He particularly noted the town of Lytton, B.C. where , — ""virtually halfway to boiling"" — last summer.,Extreme heat, he said, ""is not something that might happen or could happen or potentially happen. It is happening and it's tragic."",The report looks at ways for Canadians to adapt to higher temperatures, but Forman said it's important people also consider why extreme heat is happening. One of the biggest reasons is greenhouse gas emissions, he said.,Forman urges Ontarians, in particular, to take note of the report because there's a provincial election on June 2.,""We absolutely have to vote for climate action,"" he said. ""The scientists say that this is the time, now, where we can still turn things around, but we don't have a big window. And so we absolutely have to vote for candidates that are committed to real climate action."",Forman said the federal government has made some movement in the right direction. The government has committed to helping municipalities buy electric buses and have incentives to buy electric vehicles.,But Canada needs more funding into renewable energy, and the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by the end of the decade doesn't go far enough, he said.,""We actually need to be probably at 50 or 60 per cent reductions."",A spokesperson for federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said in an email on Friday that Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologists ""provide alerts to the public regarding the dangers, intensity and duration of the heat events,"" and work with provincial and municipal authorities to do so.,The government said it has funded initiatives ""to make communities, infrastructure and businesses more resilient"" to severe weather events, such as:,In December 2020, the spokesperson said, the government committed to developing the country's first-ever national adaptation strategy.,""Currently under development, the [strategy] will establish a shared vision for climate resilience in Canada, identify key priorities for increased collaboration and establish a framework for measuring progress at the national level,"" the email said. This work will help the federal government by informing it where it should ""best target its policies programs and investments going forward."",Both Eyquem and Feltmate add there is still time to make change, but the focus now needs to also be on how to prepare and adapt for what's to come.,""In Canada we very much have a kind of cold climate mentality. We're more worried about heating than we are about cooling,"" Eyquem said. ""Climate risk is baked into our future already, and we need to adapt to that."",Feltmate added that climate change is ""irreversible, period."",""Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will slow down the rate of change, but it's not going to reverse the situation. So we need to better prepare and we need to better prepare with a greater sense of urgency than is currently on the table."""
"Oil projects after Bay du Nord will be even harder to approve, says environment minister","Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault says it will become increasingly difficult for companies to gain approval for new oil projects as environmental regulations ramp up, but he isn't closing the door on future offshore development in Newfoundland and Labrador.,Speaking in French with ,, Guilbeault said it's up to the Impact Assessment Agency, not the federal environment minister, to make decisions on future offshore oil projects — and that approval process has become more stringent.,""It would be very difficult for a new project to pass the bar,"" he said.,Earlier this month, Guibeault controversially approved the massive Bay du Nord oil project, which Norwegian oil company Equinor is proposing to build about 500 kilometres east of St. John's. In his decision, Guilbeault said he had determined the project wouldn't cause ""significant adverse environmental effects"" with the implementation measures.,The decision to approve the project was celebrated by Newfoundland and Labrador's government and oil industry advocates but panned by environmental advocates who have been campaigning for a halt to new fossil fuel emissions.,Equinor, which hasn't yet sanctioned Bay du Nord, says the project would generate thousands of jobs and $3.5 billion in revenue for the provincial government. ,Proponents say extraction will produce relatively low emissions compared with other oil projects, but extraction accounts for only about 15 per cent of total emissions. Recent estimates suggest Bay du Nord could produce between 300 million to one billion barrels of oil over its lifetime, which in turn would generate 400 million tonnes of carbon. If sanctioned, Bay du Nord would begin production in 2028.,Guilbeault said the environmental approval process used for Bay du Nord, which was established by Stephen Harper's former Conservative government, was less rigorous than the new process put in place in 2019. He said no offshore or oilsands projects are currently undergoing environmental assessment.,""There is nothing at present that prevents a company from continuing to explore and develop a project,"" he said. ""Before such a project can be approved or not by the federal government, there are four or even five years ahead of us, and the more time passes, the more unfavourable conditions will be for oil projects."",Speaking later with CBC's ,, Guilbeault pointed out that the Impact Assessment Agency is requiring Bay du Nord to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, among other conditions. He said the world needs to shift toward renewable energy but there will still be a need for fossil fuels. ,""In an ideal world we could stop using fossil fuels tomorrow morning. That would be the best-case scenario,"" he said.,""The reality is that we can't."",Guilbeault said he believes new offshore oil projects will become less attractive for companies as the federal government ratchets up emissions pricing, with the goal of reducing oil emissions by 31 per cent by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. ,""Clearly, we are heading towards a world where there will be less and less fossil fuels in our energy portfolio and more and more renewable energies, clean technologies such as hydrogen, wind power, offshore wind power,"" he said."
Conservation group ordered to pay $33K for Epcor's legal costs in solar farm dispute,"A conservation group that fought for years to prevent Epcor from building a solar farm in Edmonton's river valley must pay for a chunk of the utility company's legal costs in defending the project, a judge has ruled.,Edmonton's city council voted 7–6 to approve rezoning for the E.L. Smith Solar Farm in 2020. ,Once complete, the $40 million-project will generate renewable energy to power Epcor's nearby water treatment plant, east of the Cameron Heights neighbourhood.,The Edmonton River Valley Conservation Coalition (ERVCC) opposed the project's location, arguing river valley land should be protected. ,In January, Alberta Court of Queen's Bench Justice George Fraser dismissed the group's judicial review to overturn city council's decision on the solar farm.,ERVCC had argued that city council had violated its river valley redevelopment plan by not determining that the river valley land was essential to the project and by placing too much weight on its financial benefits instead of its social and environmental costs.,Justice Fraser said in his decision that the solar farm was neither a major public facility nor being financed by the city, so city council did not have to prove the location was essential. In addition, he said, the city's bylaw did not outline how cost factors should be weighed.,According to last week's ,, Epcor spent nearly $240,000 in legal fees to defend the solar farm and sought to recover about 45 per cent.,The ERVCC argued it was entitled to costs because the matter was of exceptional public interest.,Justice Fraser disagreed, saying in his decision that there had not been significant public interest in the solar farm's fate. He awarded costs in Epcor's favour, but not for the amount the company was seeking. Epcor was awarded $32,689.51 in costs.,""We are pleased the court previously confirmed the correct process was followed when the solar farm was approved by city council, and this decision also validates our efforts,"" an Epcor spokesperson told CBC News last week.,The spokesperson said construction on the solar farm continues and Epcor looks forward to commissioning it later this year. ,ERVCC chair Kristine Kowalchuk said the coalition is disappointed by the costs award decision and that Epcor pursued the costs at all.,""Does it make sense to penalize a conservation group whose very mandate is to protect the river valley?"" she asked.,""What message does this decision send to groups working to stand up for the public interest in this province?"",Both parties are in the process of finalizing the cost order, a lawyer for the coalition told CBC News.,According to the costs decision, the ERVCC already raised more than $27,000 to pay its own lawyers.,Kowalchuk said the ERVCC has filed a notice of appeal of the judicial review over concerns about the decision and the group hopes the public supports their next legal challenge.,As of Wednesday, the coalition's latest crowdfunding campaign had raised $2,520 of a $40,000 goal."
Want to try out an EV? Here are some electric car rental options,"If you've ever wanted to give an electric car a try, but aren't ready to buy one, here's some good news: there are more and more options across Canada to rent one for a few hours to a few weeks, at prices that aren't that different from the cost of renting or sharing a comparable gas-powered vehicle.,Maybe you need a rental while visiting or travelling, and want a greener one, or just want to try something new. For ,, there are a few options:,If you're in Vancouver, rental giant , offers the Volvo XC40 Recharge and Hyundai Kona. They are available for on-site purchase or via an upgrade. ""Daily rates for EVs are similar to rates for our luxury vehicles,"" the company said in an email. Hertz announced in October that it was , for its fleet, but they're not yet available in Canada.,If you're in Vancouver and set on a Tesla, there's a company that specializes in that: ,. The company charges $169 per day, but offers discounts for longer rental periods.,Outside Vancouver, there are fewer options, but one available in 350 cities across Canada is ,. It's an app and website that lets individual car owners rent out their vehicles, a sort of automotive Airbnb. Users can filter for electric vehicles, hybrids or both. Turo says use of the filter tripled between February and March, as gas prices soared. Prices range from about $109 per day for a Chevy Bolt in Montreal to $130 per day for a Tesla Model 3 in Vancouver.,For drivers who need a car for shopping or day trips, there are options in some cities for , or ,.,, which offers car-sharing services in four provinces, has 113 electric vehicles, 108 of them as part of its Montreal fleet of more than 2,400 vehicles.,In Vancouver, , recently launched a Tesla-only car-sharing service targeted at locals. So far, 50 vehicles are available in the downtown, Coal Harbour and Olympic Village neighbourhoods, but the company hopes to expand soon to the West End. It has ordered 100 more vehicles and has requests to add cars in more suburban areas.,Rentals may also be a good option for people who want to ,., conducted by Dunsky Energy and Climate Advisors for Transport Canada found that a majority of dealerships across the country have no zero-emissions vehicles in stock, especially outside Quebec, B.C. and Ontario. ,Cedric Mathieu, vice-president in charge of Canada at Turo, said that means official test drives are ""very, very hard to come by."",Darryl Croft, president of the Toronto-based ,, which helps car owners transition from gas to EVs, said given the differences between the two types of vehicles, prospective owners may want more than a half-hour test drive.,""People may want to bring the vehicle home for their significant other or give it a bit of a longer test to make sure it meets their lifestyle needs,"" he said, adding they might also want to get a bit more comfortable with the logistics of charging.,At the moment, the Electric Vehicle Network offers fewer than a dozen EV and plug-in hybrid models to rent in Ontario. It's planning to expand the program to Nova Scotia and Alberta later this year, in partnership with multi-residential buildings and factories that want to make the service available to residents and employees, said Croft.,Mathieu sees Turo as a way to help people get more comfortable with EVs. Renters can get tips from owners as well as firsthand experience. Meanwhile, owners can offset the higher cost of EVs. ,He added, ""It's also a great way to share your enthusiasm and your knowledge about electric cars."",— ,Last week, Inayat Singh wrote about ,., wrote,""Really enjoyed this and many of your articles. Battery recycling is so important and many don't know how much of these rare earth minerals like cobalt we can extract from spent batteries. ,""I have to give a plug to such a homegrown facility run by , in Ontario, which the province and feds have invested a lot of money in to secure our supply and promote Ontario as a hub of the EV industry. Electra is about to commission their cobalt sulfate refinery in December followed by their battery recycling plant in 2023. They intend to have the lowest carbon footprint of all cobalt sulfate producers in the world.

There is a big demand for these batteries and they need very little work to convert to 120V. In an off-grid house they can last another 10 years before the need for recycling! Off-grid houses run off of solar or wind, not coal, gas, nuclear or hydro dams. ‎,""The reason this is so perfect is that a car battery needs to have capacity to travel a decent distance, and a house doesn't,"" wrote Vogel, who signed his email with ""Off Grid on the Canadian Shield."",Climate change is having myriad impacts, which include threatening the long-term viability of our food supply. From wheat to corn to almonds, many crops are imperiled by increasing heat and less access to water. As author Dan Saladino has pointed out, ,, where we are able to grow a certain number of crops in great abundance and feed more people. But he warns that this will not work in our favour as global warming becomes more acute.,In his book ,, Saladino explains why the key to survival is food diversity — that is, ensuring the health of as many crop species as possible, so that if climate change jeopardizes certain species, others might survive. To illustrate his point, he cites the example of another endangered crop: coffee. Scientists have identified 130 coffee bean species, but the world relies on two, arabica and robusta — both of which are susceptible to the effects of climate change. Arabica, for example, grows best at temperatures around 19 C, and any deviation from that can lead to a drop in productivity and the risk of fungal disease.,Saladino reports that in 2018, scientists found and cultivated a species called ,, which had last been found in Sierra Leone in the 1950s. This species has a number of benefits, both environmental and gustatory: as Saladino writes, "", can cope with higher temperatures and possesses greater tolerance to drought, as well as being a great-tasting coffee, one that Victorian botanists even described as 'superior' to arabica."",Susan Lawrence knows her plants. ,She and her partner, Robert Baldwin, own and operate Baldwin Nurseries in Upper Falmouth, N.S. Over 27 years, the nursery has grown into a two-hectare operation offering tree seedlings, shrubs, perennials and more. ,But Baldwin Nurseries offers something not all plant sellers provide ⁠— native Nova Scotian species. ,""For me, it's exciting to see a young couple coming in, and they want to do a garden, they want a pollinator garden,"" Lawrence said. ""They want as much native [vegetation] as they can get."",Over the last six years, she's noticed an increase in interest for native plant species. Plants indigenous to the area now make up about 20 per cent of stock, something Lawrence said brings benefits to a home garden.,""When you have a native species, it'll be more successful,"" she said. ""It's already used to the climate here.,""There's going to be no problem with a harsh winter or droughts. It's already been here for so long. So it's adaptable."",Melanie Priesnitz, a conservation horticulturist at Acadia University's Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens, has spent much of her life working with native plants. The gardens have more than 250 different species, all native to the region.,""A plant native to here is one that existed prior to European settlement, and its range is the Acadian Forest,"" Priesnitz said. ,""Before European settlement, it was called the Wabanaki Forest, named by the Mi'kmaq of this whole area, which is the land of the dawn where the sun first rises."",The Wabanaki Forest region includes the Maritime provinces, parts of Quebec and certain areas of the northwestern U.S.,Priesnitz said there were originally more than 1,400 indigenous species in the region until colonization, when around 900 non-native species were introduced.,""It really changed our ecosystem here. It changed what the Wabanaki Forest is."",Priesnitz said there are many benefits to planting native species in a garden. That includes insect resistance, saving water, deterring invasive species and using fewer pesticides and fertilizers.,""Gardening with native plants is really giving back to the land,"" Priesnitz said. ""It's providing habitat for wildlife, it's putting the right plant in the right place. It's reforesting areas, it's trying to restore pieces of land that we have changed.,""We can really make a difference to the natural world by making good, responsible choices about planting."",The botanical gardens have native plants like ostrich fern (see photo above), yellow twig dogwood, mayflower and bayberry that could easily be planted in a home garden.,Lawrence grows and sells bayberry, a plant known for its fragrance, at the nursery.

"Ottawa, N.L. disagree on who will foot hefty Bay du Nord royalty bill","Canada could soon be the first country on Earth to pay millions of dollars in international oil royalties as a consequence of the Bay du Nord megaproject in Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore — but just how that bill gets paid remains to be seen.,Article 82 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea allows countries like Canada — known as ""broad margin"" states that have larger-than-normal continental shelves — to extract offshore oil beyond their 200-nautical-mile limit.,But that extraction comes with a catch: broad margin states must pay royalties on that oil, money which then gets redistributed to developing countries.,Bay du Nord, spearheaded by Norwegian oil giant Equinor, is the first project to move the province's offshore oil industry past Canada's nautical limit and into the deep waters of the Flemish Pass, which sits 270 nautical miles — about 500 kilometres — east of St. John's.,Although Bay du Nord moved closer to commissioning this month — with a green light , — Ottawa and the Newfoundland and Labrador government still haven't agreed on just how the hefty royalty bill resulting from the United Nations convention will be paid.,Michael Gardner, a Halifax-based consultant who previously studied the issue for Natural Resources Canada, said Wednesday that UNCLOS royalties from the project could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.,""It all comes back down to, what are the production levels that you reach and what's the price of oil?"" Gardner said.,So where will that money come from?,The federal government negotiated UNCLOS in the 1970s, and Parliament ratified the document in 2003. Ottawa says the provincial government should help pay the royalties, but the province, which expects to receive $3.5 billion from Bay du Nord, rejects that suggestion outright — and has for years.,""The federal government is the signatory to UNCLOS, and would be responsible for making payments under Article 82,"" said Andrew Parsons, Newfoundland and Labrador's energy minister, in a statement last week.,""The province does not see a role for itself in this agreement."",The Newfoundland and Labrador government receives all of its offshore revenues through a deal with Ottawa known as the Atlantic Accord.,Ottawa could impose an additional levy on Equinor to help meet its international obligations.,But that approach carries risks, warned Gardner.,""At some point, if the operator is squeezed sufficiently, it no longer is an economic proposition,"" he said.,""It's that old Norwegian expression: you don't want to kill the cow you're trying to milk."",In a statement, Equinor spokesperson Alex Collins said, ""Decision-making regarding the implementation of UNCLOS royalties rests with the government of Canada."",Collins declined to answer further questions.,""The implementation of this mechanism in Canada, including the input from the various parties, is still under development,"" said Miriam Galipeau, a spokesperson for Natural Resources Canada.,Armand de Mestrahl, a member of the Canadian team that negotiated UNCLOS in the 1970s, said he believes a compromise between the provincial and federal government is inevitable.,""Don't forget that without that international agreement, which was painstakingly negotiated over several years by the federal government, there would be no formula. There would be no rights. We had to fight so that the international community would respect Canada's right,"" de Mestrahl said in an interview in French with Radio-Canada.,""People in Newfoundland … say, 'They stole our rights away.' It's easy to say that, but it's almost petty because the federal government and the Canadian delegation put in incredible effort to ensure that the continental shelf would be recognized."",He added, however, that Ottawa would be remiss to overlook the provincial government's current considerable debt load and series of structural deficits.,""It's hard to see how the government won't concede anything,"" de Mestrahl said.,Ottawa and the provincial government still have years to come to an agreement.,Production at Bay du Nord isn't expected to begin until at least 2028, and under UNCLOS, no international royalties are due during the first five years of production, in a measure meant to help operators recoup upfront capital costs.,Annual royalty payments of one per cent of gross production revenues begin after the sixth year of production, and increase by one percentage point per year until the 12th year. Thereafter, royalty payments remain at seven per cent, according to the Canada Energy Regulator's website.,Bay du Nord is expected to produce at least 300 million barrels of oil over 30 years.,In a 2020 article, Dalhousie University law professor Aldo Chircop warned, ""There could be the realistic prospect of prolonged federal-provincial litigation"" over who pays the UNCLOS royalties."",But in an interview last week, he said, ""We live in the era of co-operative federalism. So basically what that means is that the federal and provincial governments will work together on this to find a way.,""Newfoundland would recognize that the reason why there is this offshore development out there is because of the Law of the Sea convention, which creates an obligation for them. And therefore, they would have to work with the federal government to honour this international obligation."",In an email regarding UNCLOS from October and obtained through access-to-information legislation, an employee at Newfoundland and Labrador's energy ministry wrote, ""Discussions between the federal and provincial governments, and industry are ongoing as to how to meet this obligation."""
It's been a remarkable week for rare birds in Newfoundland. Here's why ,"For wildlife photographer Shawn Fitzpatrick, there's nothing quite like spotting a rare bird in Newfoundland. And so far, this spring has been a real banger.,Over the last week or so, several winged creatures from as far away as Europe, Russia and Iceland have been blown off-course and into the frame of passionate St. John's birder Shawn Fitzpatrick.,""It's like winning a Stanley Cup or something, winning a hockey game or getting the gold,"" Fitzpatrick told ,guest host Dave Seglins. ,""You get that elated feeling from within you."",And he's not alone. Bird lovers across the province have been out with their binoculars, hoping to get a look at the rare creatures.,Jared Clarke, who runs the St. John's nature tour business Bird the Rock, says Newfoundland is a great place to see birds that are ""exceptionally rare in North America"" but tend to show up in the province in the spring because of its prime location on the eastern edge of the continent. ,Most of them, he said, are taking an unplanned detour on their way to breed elsewhere.,""Very occasionally, like last week, a bunch of these [rare birds] will show up all at once due to a weather system that produces strong, persistent winds blowing across the North Atlantic,"" Clarke said in an email. ,""These winds pick up birds that are typically migrating between western Europe (e.g. Ireland) and breeding grounds in Iceland or Greenland."",So far, Clarke says he knows of nine black-tailed godwits spotted in Bonavista and one in Argentia; eight barnacle geese in Bonavista and four in Portugal Cove South; a northern lapwing in Goulds, more than a dozen European golden plovers in Cape Race, Portugal Cove South, Trepassey and Springdale; and a Pacific golden plover in Cape Race.,But perhaps the rarest gem of them all — a brambling — has been spotted in the town of Renews-Cappahayden. This migratory bird is also known as the cock o' the north or the mountain finch, and Clarke says that as far as he's aware, it's the first time one has been recorded in the province.,""Who knows what else was out there,"" Clarke said. ""Excitingly, the forecast is calling for similar winds much of next week, so this may not be over yet."",Fitzpatrick has been lucky enough to snap some shots of the brambling, as well as a few other birds on Clarke's list. He was in the Renews area taking more pictures on Wednesday.,""It doesn't rain; it pours sometimes, as they say,"" Fitzpatrick said.,Most of these visitor birds are known to ornithologists as ""vagrants"" — birds that aren't from Canada, but sometimes end up here anyway.,And when they show up, it's like Christmas for birdwatchers, says David Bird, a professor emeritus of wildlife biology at Montreal's McGill University, who just wrapped up editing the third edition of the guidebook ,He says people will flock to Newfoundland from all over the world in the springtime in the hopes of catching a glimpse of one of these migratory creatures. ,""I look upon these birds, these vagrants, as kind of treasures,"" Bird said.,But there is a downside. Bird says it's not entirely clear whether the animals will be able carry on with their journeys north to breed now that they've been blown off course. And once they're in Newfoundland, they stand out to predators because they're so unusual looking.,""Birds are like people,"" he said. ""They really want to go somewhere they're familiar with."",With climate change bringing more powerful weather systems, Bird says more of these vagrants could end up estranged in unfamiliar terrain. ,""But I don't think they're doomed, by any stretch,"" he said, noting that birds are ""hard wired"" to complete their breeding cycles.,The mysteries of how birds navigate isn't fully understood, he said, but some species have been known to find their way back to their breeding grounds from thousands of kilometres away after being taken from their natural habitat by scientists. ,Ultimately, he says anything that gets people outdoors with their binoculars is a good thing. ,""They provide an opportunity for birders to discover new treasures, and it makes them want to birdwatch more, which is a good thing for wildlife,"" Bird said. ""We need to have people care about birds."",Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick, who has been birding for over 10 years, has high hopes for his feathered friends.,""I think that they'll get back on track and they'll find a way to Greenland,"" he said. "
"Government expanding electric vehicle rebate program to include trucks, vans, SUVs","The federal government is expanding its electric vehicle rebate program to include larger vehicles such as vans, SUVs and trucks which previously had not qualified.,The program, launched in 2019, offers a $5,000 rebate for fully electric vehicles and $2,500 for hybrid vehicles,Starting next week, the rebate will be extended to cars with a base model price below $55,000 and to SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans with a base model price below $60,000.,Consumers who buy those vehicles can choose higher trims or add options worth up to $10,000 and still qualify for the rebate.,That means a car with a base model price of $55,000 with a trim price of $65,000 would still qualify, while a car with a base model price of $60,000 would not be eligible.,For example, the Tesla Model 3, with a base price of $61,380, would be excluded from the program, while the ""premium"" trim of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, priced slightly higher at $61,895, would qualify.,The previous rebate was available only to cars priced under $55,000.,The program's expansion was announced in the budget earlier this month but Transport Minister Omar Alghabra announced the new details on Friday.,""The expansion of the incentive program I'm announcing today will provide Canadians with more opportunities to purchase or lease the vehicle that meets their needs,"" he said.,In addition to the price cap expansion, the full $5,000 rebate will now also be offered to hybrid vehicles with an electric range of 50 kilometres or more.,The budget allocated $1.7 billion to continue the program into 2025 and expand its scope.,The government is aiming to make 100 per cent of new vehicle sales zero-emission by 2035., "
"Plans underway for Boreal Wildlands Project, called the largest private conservation agreement in Canada","Plans are underway to create the Boreal Wildlands Project, the largest single private conservation project in the country, in northern Ontario, Nature Conservancy Canada (NCC) said Friday.,The non-profit organization had been in discussions with paper industry titan Domtar to purchase the 1,500-square-kilometre parcel of boreal forest west of Hearst for $7 million below its market value,,.,The federal and provincial governments are also chipping in, matching the land value with funds from the Natural Heritage Conservation Program and Greenlands Conservation Partnership, respectively. ,A large private tract spanning 1,450 square kilometres of boreal forest that was managed as a wood supply to Domtar's pulp and paper mills will now be managed for research and conservation by the NCC.,The area, part of the Hearst Forest, is recognized for its extraordinary ecosystem and abundant wildlife.,When the deal is finalized, the protected area will be roughly twice the size of Toronto and home to several at-risk species, including woodland caribou and over 300 species of birds. ,Once complete, the Boreal Wildlands will support Canada's targets to conserve 25 per cent of the country's lands and waters by 2025 and 30 per cent by 2030, the NCC said, and will connect with two other provincial parks —Nagagamisis and Missinaibi — to form an ecological corridor. ,Kristyn Ferguson, a program director with NCC, said the project is a chance for the group to act locally, but have a global impact.,The forests, the plants, the wetlands on this property already store and continue to store so much carbon, pulling it right out of the atmosphere, cleaning the air we breathe and reducing carbon emissions from the air,"" Ferguson said. ,""Currently, the property is storing the equivalent of the lifetime emissions of 3 million vehicles, and there's only more carbon storage to come. So we see it as a really important piece to address climate change."",Ferguson said the NCC also consulted about project plans with neighbouring First Nations.,""We're working closely with communities who have traditional territory on the site, like Constance Lake First Nation,"" she said. ""We're pleased to be in the early stages of building what we hope are long-term, meaningful, respectful relationships to honour Indigenous relations to the land, respect their rights and find out where we can work in collaboration together and do even more great things jointly on the land."" ,The group is still soliciting donations, hoping to raise $13 million for the completion of the project.,Ferguson said the project has a targeted completion date of August. , "
Health Canada approves AstraZeneca COVID-19 prevention drug for immunocompromised patients,"Canada on Thursday authorized British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc's antibody-based therapy for preventing COVID-19 infections, giving itself another weapon against the disease as cases rise in the country.,Health Canada has cleared the drug — Evusheld — for use in individuals aged 12 years and older who are immunocompromised and unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, or for whom COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended.,While vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, Evusheld contains the lab-made antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab, which are designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.,A health-care professional administers each antibody through an injection, usually in the buttocks.,Side effects for up to one in 10 recipients are said to potentially include a rash, pain or itching at the site of injection, with a much smaller number of people potentially experiencing headaches, chills or soreness after receiving the shots.,Health Canada said in a statement on Thursday that there is not yet enough data to be sure that Evusheld is safe for use in those pregnant or breastfeeding, so those individuals are advised to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a health-care professional.,The therapy has already been authorized in the United States and its use has also been recommended by the European Medicines Agency.,Citing studies from Israel and the United States, AstraZeneca said in a statement Thursday that immunocompromised individuals can be at risk of hospitalization from breakthrough COVID infections.,""The key to ending the COVID-19 pandemic is protecting as many people as possible against infection, including those who may need an additional layer of protection to prevent COVID-19 than vaccines alone can provide. We welcome today's approval as an important step along this journey,"" said said Kiersten Combs, president of AstraZeneca Canada.,An estimated 14 per cent of Canadians aged 15 years or older have a compromised immune system that increases their risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19, according to a Statistics Canada survey series from 2020.,Evusheld was tested against the BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2 subvariants of Omicron , from Washington University in the U.S., a study that was not peer reviewed.,Data from the study showed the therapy reduced the amount of virus detected in samples, the viral load, of all tested Omicron subvariants in mice lungs, AstraZeneca said. It was also shown in the study to limit inflammation in the lungs, a critical symptom in severe COVID-19 infections.,""Evusheld is expected to retain neutralizing activity against Omicron subvariant BA.2, which is now the dominant variant in many communities in Canada,"" Health Canada said in its statement Thursday.,With respect to humans, Evusheld was found to cut the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77 per cent in trials that took place largely before Omicron hit, Britain's drug regulator said last month. Protection lasted for at least six months after a single dose, Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said.,The MHRA said that the treatment should not be administered to people infected with the COVID-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, or those who have had recent exposure to someone with the virus.,Omicron's properties have seen it evade vaccine protection to a greater degree than previous variants, as well as blunt some monoclonal antibody treatments that had been utilized for some patients, such as casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab.,AstraZeneca announced in February it had struck a deal with the federal government to supply 100,000 doses of Evusheld to be delivered in 2022, pending its approval in Canada.,AstraZeneca's partnership with Oxford University led to one of the earliest approved COVID-19 vaccines. While a rare clotting issue found in some vaccine recipients led many Western countries, including Canada, to de-emphasize its use, the vaccine has been given to just under three million Canadians and 67 million people globally, according to data from Health Canada and tracking by Our World in Data, respectively."
Running changed two Haudenosaunee men in Ontario. Now one of them is headed to the Boston Marathon,"On Monday, the Boston Marathon will see 30,000 runners for its 126th race.,Among the thousands will be one Haudenosaunee man running for charity.,Joel Matthew Kennedy, 37, a Bear Clan member of the Oneida Nation, is setting off from his home in Ontario Friday, travelling to Boston for the Easter weekend race. ,It's a goal he can hardly believe he is close to achieving. ,""If someone told me back in 2015 that I would be running marathons at this point I wouldn't believe them, I wouldn't believe myself,"" the London-based father said. ""Even when I started running my five and 10 kilometres, I never thought I would progress to a marathon as fast as I did. I knew at one point, down the road, it would happen but I didn't know it would be that quick."",Kennedy won't be the first Haudenosaunee man to run in Boston. Legendary long-distance runner Tom Longboat, from Six Nations of the Grand River — who twice ran away when attending the former Mohawk Institute Residential School — , in 1907. ,More than 100 years later, Kennedy is following in his footsteps. ,His own running journey began around 2015, when he was out to improve his health with the desire to prevent diabetes. First he lost nearly 150 pounds. Then he started to run. ,He founded the Indigenous Running Club in 2016 and entered his first marathons. He has now run several, including in Calgary and Chicago. ,""Knowing how overweight I was and how much I changed my life is just overwhelming as a bigger picture,"" he said recently, before the Boston race.,That ""bigger picture"" mentality is what pushed Kennedy to make his runs about raising funds for charity. He had COVID-19 in January 2021, and the virus affected his lungs.,""I was really worried that I wouldn't be able to run. Part of what got me through it was praying and thoughts. I remember thinking 'I want to run for more than myself now,' because up to that point I was always focused on improving myself,"" he said. ,After his recovery from the virus, he went on to run a 50km Ultra Marathon in Calgary in September 2021, raising funds for Yotuni, a London-based social enterprise that supports Indigenous youth. ,Kennedy's story is one that caught the attention of the Official Charity Program of the Boston Athletics Association, which oversees the applications to run the marathon for a good cause. ,As part of his application, he needed to choose an organization to offer donation to, and not finding an Indigenous organization on the approved-charity list, he selected the Peer Health Exchange. The organization began in 2006 and focuses on support for youth in the greater Boston area. He said that what pushed him to select the Peer Health Exchange was its focus on BIPOC youth. ,And what would he say to youth with an interest in running or pursuing a goal that feels out of reach? ,""I think it's really important for people to understand that they can achieve it,"" he said. ""The important thing is to keep your goal. Understand that you might have to make other goals to reach and obtain that large goal but you will get there. It may take time, it will take commitment, but you will get to that goal. You just have to allow yourself to believe in yourself and what I like to say is 'put in the work that is needed to reach the goal, because having a goal without a plan is just a wish.'"",Kennedy is one of just two chosen to run for the Peer Health Exchange. His plan is to hit the US$10,000 donation mark by race day, and as of Thursday was US$1,500 shy of the goal. ,In October, Kennedy ran the Chicago Marathon, one of the six World Marathon Majors, in under six hours — his first time doing so. The time is a requirement for charity runners. ,""Boston isn't an easy marathon to get into,"" he said, adding that 80 percent of participants qualify by their run times. ""It's easy to get caught up in the idea of improvement but with this kind of run, you put in all of the work leading up to the run and you have to trust the process."",Another requirement is to raise that US$10,000 amount (around CAD$12,500). The N'Amerind Friendship Centre in London, where Kennedy works as the Urban Aboriginal Healthy Living Coordinator, offered a donation early on in his pursuit.,""It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and the money is going somewhere good,"" he said, noting that if he can't reach his fundraising goal, he will consider paying for the rest of the donation himself.   ,He acknowledged that the Boston Marathon is a bucket-list item for many long-distance runners, and that his qualifying is something he hopes will inspire other Haudenosaunee people to break new ground and normalize pursuing and achieving their goals.,""When you take a step back and look at the overall picture of how much you improve your health, it's really overwhelming just to think about where you were and how far you've come. The biggest thing about my journey is that I started sharing it and the impact that it had on the people and community around me,"" he said. ,Kennedy is currently working towards his coaching certification through the National Coaching Certificate Program. He hopes to focus on developing runners with similar backgrounds as himself in the near future. ,His story has already hit close to home, and helped to begin the running journey of Lyall Martin. ,Martin, 42, is a Turtle Clan member of the Mohawk Nation of the Six Nations community and a father of two. ,Having both a 22-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son, Martin's interests are held firm in improving and maintaining his health to ensure longevity and fulfilment for his family, he said, much like Kennedy.,""I just want to be around as long as I can to watch them grow, and running is the health component for me,"" he said.,Having grown up in Hamilton, Martin later moved to London, where he met Kennedy in 1990. The two have been friends since meeting in public school. Martin explained that he was part of a group on social media that included his brother, Kennedy, and Kennedy's brother and through the group, Martin found the inspiration to run. ,""[Kennedy] would post pictures and updates into the chat and about a year into his journey,"" he said. ""He posted inspirational content and as time passed, he just kept progressing."",Martin said that he would run at the Emily C. General Elementary School grounds on Six Nations, where he now lives once again, and was the only runner from Six Nations to run with the Indigenous Running Club. ,His first run took place in June 2016, when the club began. He has since completed runs in Six Nations, Toronto, London, Burlington and Waterloo.,But with his love for the activity, he said that he faced his own set of obstacles. Two years ago, after climbing a tree to install a security camera outside of his home, he slipped and fell. This caused a fracture to his left leg that resulted in bone chipping and cracking from his ankle to below his kneecap.  ,""They had to put a steel plate and 12 screws in there, and this happened back in 2020. I couldn't run and through that whole year, I was off of work for four months. But the next year, in 2021, I was able to run two kilometres, but the hardware got infected and I had to get that taken out. I couldn't run again,"" he said.,Following the fracture, Martin also contracted COVID-19.,""The same thing that happened to Joel also happened to me, where we both had COVID-19. I had it back in January,"" he said.,Now recovered, Martin would like to change his trajectory this month. ,""I really wanted to get back to my running journey, I really like to run. It's just something that I can't even explain, but it's kind of a lifestyle. I mainly started running because of Joel, but I want to keep my heart and lungs up to par so I can live to be an old man and watch my children and grandkids grow."",But it's not just about health for him. ,""Running gives you solitude, and a lot of time to think and de-stress,"" he said. ""When you're running with other people, it helps a bit because you won't want to stop. Especially when you see a 70-year-old woman pass you, it inspires you. I've been all over Ontario and the people that run are nice, they'll say 'hi' to you, and sometimes you'll have a random conversation with people you don't know."",When asked about advice he would offer to youth looking to start running, he said that the discipline can impact life in more ways than one.,""I used to work at the youth drop-in here so I always have a soft spot for the youth, I almost wish I still did so that I could get them into running,"" he said. ""Running teaches discipline and purpose and that translates into life; my advice is to never give up and keep pursuing."",It's stories like Martin's that will be with Kennedy as he runs in Boston this weekend. ,""I just can't believe how far my story has reached and how many people it has inspired to improve their health,"" he said."
"An actor, a hockey reporter, a 12-year-old: These are some victims of B.C.'s toxic drug crisis","Six years ago, Dr. Perry Kendall — then B.C.'s chief public health officer — declared a , due to the escalating number of overdose deaths in the province.,Talking recently about the announcement, Kendall said it was ""meant to bring public and political attention to the emerging crisis."" ,But while he says he has seen some progress on the issue, it has not been enough to save thousands of lives from toxic drugs.,""We have seen a shocking, unacceptable and unconscionable increase in the number of deaths,"" Kendall said.,According to the B.C. Coroners Service, , from ingesting toxic, illicit drugs over the past six years.,Chief coroner Lisa Lapointe says while there are some patterns — such as people using alone, and a higher number of deaths among men aged 30 to 59 years old — victims of the crisis come from all walks of life.,Lapointe says there is a misconception that the only people at risk are regular drug users. In fact, she says, many are first-time or casual users who think they are purchasing a certain drug only to get something contaminated with fentanyl or other, even more lethal, substances.,""The drugs are indiscriminate,"" she said. ,""We are just seeing lives being lost month after month, year after year.

Worldwide COVID-19 cases surpass 500 million as Omicron subvariant BA.2 surges,"Global COVID-19 cases surpassed 500 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, as the highly contagious BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron surges in many countries in Europe and Asia.,The rise of BA.2 has been blamed for recent surges in China as well as record infections in Europe, while South Korea leads the world in the daily average number of new cases, reporting more than 182,000 new infections a day and accounting for one in every four infections globally, according to a Reuters analysis.,New cases are rising in 20 out of more than 240 countries and territories tracked, including Taiwan, Thailand and Bhutan.,Shanghai is fighting China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since the novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, with almost 25,000 new local cases reported, although the city's quarantine policy is criticized for separating children from parents and putting asymptomatic cases among those with symptoms.,""Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,"" Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission, told a briefing.,In Canada, federal officials said the recent surge across Canada has ,.,Some European countries are now seeing a slower uptick in new cases, or even a decline, but the region is still reporting over one million cases about every two days, according to the Reuters tally.,In Germany, the seven-day average of new infections has fallen and is now at nearly 60 per cent of its previous peak in late March. New cases are also falling in the United Kingdom and Italy, while they are holding steady in France.,Overall, COVID-19 cases in the United States have dropped sharply after hitting record levels in January, but the resurgence of cases in parts of Asia and Europe has raised concerns that another wave could follow in the United States.,The U.S. national public health agency said on Monday the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron was estimated to account for nearly three of every four coronavirus variants in the country.,The BA.2 variant now makes up about 86 per cent of all sequenced cases globally, according to the World Health Organization. It is known to be more transmissible than the BA.1 and BA.1.1 Omicron sub-variants. Evidence so far, though, suggests BA.2 is no more likely to cause severe disease.,Scientists continue to emphasize vaccines are critical for avoiding the devastation the virus can cause.,Roughly 65 per cent of the world population has received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, although only around 15 per cent of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose, according to figures from Our World in Data.,While cases have flared in Europe and Asia recently, the United States still has the highest total COVID-19 infections since the start of the pandemic with 80.41 million, followed by India with 43.04 million and Brazil with 30.14 million.,Since 2020, about 37 per cent of the world's COVID-19 cases have been in Europe, 21 per cent in Asia and 17 per cent in North America.,About 6.5 million people have lost their lives to COVID-19 since the pandemic began. The United States has reported the highest number of deaths, followed by Russia, Brazil and India.,Russia overtook Brazil to have the world's second-highest death toll from COVID-19, data from Russia's state statistics service and Reuters calculations showed on Thursday."
Ridges on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa could mean water — and life,"Scientists have found that Jupiter's moon Europa may have liquid water relatively near the surface, which increases the possibility of the existence of life.,""It was really surprising and exciting,"" said lead study author Riley Culberg in an interview with , host Bob McDonald. ""Suddenly we're discovering new things about a different part of our solar system that we just didn't understand before."",Europa is one of Jupiter's largest moons. It has long fascinated scientists because it is covered in a layer of ice up to 30 kilometres thick, and data suggests that this ice shell floats on top of an ocean that ranges from 60-150 kilometres deep.,Because of this, it has long been considered a prime candidate for hosting life, as liquid water is thought to be an essential ingredient for evolving and maintaining life. But considering the depth and thickness of the ice shell, it would be incredibly difficult to get to for an exploratory mission.,The possible presence of shallow water changes that.,""Maybe these kinds of shallow water pockets are themselves habitable, or at least preserve evidence of life from a subsurface ocean that might be easier to access,"" said Culberg.,The research was published in the journal ,.,The team were looking at geographic features in the ice called double ridges. ""If you were to cut one of these in half and look at the cross-section, it would look a lot like the capital letter M,"" said Culberg, a PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University. ,""And on Europa, these are really large. Maybe 150 to 200 metres tall, and they can be up to 500 kilometres long. And we really see them all over the moon."",Culberg typically studies climate change impacts on the Greenland ice sheet. When talking with a colleague who studies Europa, they noted that these double ridges were present on both ice sheets. And even though the terrestrial ridges are only two metres tall, their shapes suggested they were formed in the same way. ,""There's a rather characteristic ratio between the distance between the two peaks of the ridge and the total height of the ridge,"" said Culberg. ""So it gives us a sense that maybe the same kind of processes are at play, even though the absolute scale of these things is quite different."",Using data from missions such as NASA's Operation Ice Bridge, which gathers detailed imagery of Greenland's ice sheet and how it is formed, Culberg and his team were able to peer underneath the double ridge here on Earth. They found the ridge was being formed by a big pocket of water melting and refreezing, which would expand and push the ice sheet up to create the ridge. ,""That interior core of liquid water was basically able to explode upwards and push up these two ridges at the surface,"" he said. He believes the same would be happening on Europa.,""In order to get these kinds of liquid water pockets inside of the shell, water would really have to be coming from the bottom up. So perhaps it's getting forced up from the ocean through fractures into the ice shell, or possibly there could be some kind of internal melting of these rising plumes of warm, buoyant ice."",NASA engineers have been hard at work designing robotics and rovers that could explore the icy moon.,""It's one of the most promising locations in our solar system for where we might find other signs of life,"" NASA engineer Andy Klesh ,. Klesh is currently testing a robot that would explore where the ice and water meet, which is the most likely spot for life.,""Algae and microbes tend to use photosynthesis and actually anchor on that underside of the ice where they themselves can be protected from the currents that are around there in the air,"" said Klesh. ""Certainly there won't be a lot of light [on Europa], but there will still be that anchoring point for many of the different microbes. ,Culberg adds that it will be much easier to find life if missions don't have to go through 30 kilometres of ice to find it. ,""Shallow water certainly makes it an easier target if we're trying to look for it with scientific imaging, or with some kind of access or sampling,"" he said.,While Klesh's rover is still at least a decade away from being put to work, there are several other missions to Europa in various stages of planning and development.,NASA hopes to launch , in a couple of years, which will provide researchers like Culberg a better look at what's happening underneath the ice.,""We're really excited that [The Europa Clipper spacecraft] has an ice-penetrating radar on it, because that's exactly the instrument we used in Greenland to study this double ridge. And so there's going to be some exciting data coming out of the Clipper mission for looking for these kinds of processes,"" he said."
Alberta's pandemic messaging under fire as COVID-19 rates rise,"As COVID-19 transmission rises in Alberta, there are growing concerns messaging from the provincial government could harm efforts to blunt the curve and protect hospitals from even further strain.,Transmission, wastewater levels and hospitalizations are all increasing, but politicians and health officials have yet to label the surge a ""sixth wave,"" despite statements from doctors and scientists that it is ,.,During a news conference Wednesday, Alberta's chief medical officer of health acknowledged the rising metrics and noted positivity rates had generally plateaued (albeit at high levels with a seven-day average of 26.6 per cent).,However, Dr. Deena Hinshaw stopped short of committing to the idea Alberta is in a sixth wave.,""The magnitude of this rise, how long it will last — those are questions we don't know the answers to yet,"" she said.,""Whatever we term it, whether it's called a sixth wave or whether we're talking about just the rise in transmission we've seen, we certainly all know the kinds of things that can help protect ourselves and those around us."",This doesn't sit well with Dr. Noel Gibney, professor emeritus of critical care medicine at the University of Alberta.,""It's dangerous because it's stopping the messaging getting out there that … COVID has not gone away,"" he said.,""I think the messaging we're getting from the province is trying to downplay the significance of where we are.… If people don't fully understand where we are — that indeed we're in the early stages of a sixth wave, where the numbers could actually be higher than anything else that we've experienced before — I think that that places the public in a bad place."",COVID-19 hospitalizations didn't have time to drop significantly after the fifth wave before they started rising again.,And Gibney said hospitals — particularly those in Calgary and Edmonton — are under significant pressure.,The latest data shows, as of Monday, there were 1,053 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 48 in intensive care.,Despite all this, both Health Minister Jason Copping and Premier Jason Kenney have said recently they don't anticipate hospitals will be strained to a point that necessitates the reintroduction of public health measures.,""We may well see hospitalization numbers that potentially exceed anything that we've seen to date. And so for the government to say we're not under pressure, I think, is misleading,"" said Gibney.,Other experts agree on the need for a clear declaration the sixth wave has arrived.,""I think it does matter because it signals to the public that this isn't over — we still need to take steps to protect ourselves and to protect our loved ones and to protect our health-care system,"" said Timothy Caulfield, Canada research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta.,""By not acknowledging what's going on, I think you invite the public to not acknowledge it, too, and that's not the role of the government. A government should be leading. They should be leading this conversation and they're not."",The message that is coming from the Alberta government, according to Caulfield, is that people need to make their own risk assessments. But with a dramatic reduction in reporting and surveillance, he said, there's no longer enough data to do that.,""I think Albertans are kind of left in a pretty confused state,"" he said, noting he believes many Albertans are frustrated.,""[They] would love to have more clarity about what is needed right now from a public health perspective, and I also think they would like to have more clarity on where the government thinks COVID is going in this province."",Part of the problem, according to Caulfield, is the Alberta government is allowing politics to drive these health policy decisions.,""I think the Alberta government, and to be honest, I think there are many governments around the world that have, from a political perspective, painted themselves into a corner,"" he said.,""They don't want to sound like there's any kind of retreat. And I get that from a political perspective. But these decision should be driven by public health needs and what the numbers actually say."",Meanwhile, Gibney said now is the time to reconsider a mask mandate, encourage booster shots, increase PCR testing and improve access to , in an effort to protect as many people as possible.,""COVID isn't gone. COVID is not endemic. COVID is still very much a pandemic."""
"I was an overwhelmed family doctor. So at age 45, I called it quits","On April Fool's Day, I turned in my medical licence. It was no joke.,A sense of deep relief immediately replaced the weight on my shoulders. It was the weight of thousands of stories heard over 18 years of medicine. The weight of empathy and patience, of responsibility to do no harm and of personal sacrifice.,Leaving my practice at the age of 45 is bittersweet. There are things that I already miss, like the privilege of being part of the lives of 2,000 people. I'd made a point early on to take on patients from all walks of life: language, religion, socioeconomic status and, importantly, health challenges.,Being indiscriminate added an extra dimension of challenge, but it was well worth it to discover the richness of Montreal's people.,However, often I'd leave my clinic in Montreal's Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood exhausted, drained of emotion, unable to form full sentences. I'd come home after midnight to face my partner, children, the dog and the chickens, feeling like I had nothing left to give them.,I felt sorry for short-changing the people I loved the most and tried to convince myself that I was acting out a sense of duty to my community. I knew early on that this could not continue, but braved through it under the false impression that I was in some way irreplaceable.,Never being great at long-term planning, work at my family medicine clinic soon spiralled out of control. I had learned at a medical conference that it's best to shake your head while saying no, yet I was a hopeless yes man. Before I knew it, I had 1,000 patients. And between 2014 and 2018, that number doubled.,I was healthy, stable and privileged. So many people were not. I should have been able to help them all, right?,The adrenaline rush of a busy clinic always felt as though 50 ropes were pulling me in separate directions. It was a juggling act, but with profound consequences when a ball was dropped.,Between a poor referral network and personnel shortages, I felt compelled to take on the roles of dietitian, physiotherapist, psychologist, nurse and spiritual adviser, to name a few.,But what disappointed me the most is the lack of technological progress in medicine. The app that controls my robot vacuum cleaner is far smarter than the electronic medical record (EMR) system I was forced to use. And I know about apps — I spent seven years building my own records system.,So many times I sat frustrated, begging my USB dongle to contact the mother ship to get results for the patient sitting in front of me — typing my password eight times in a row to finally get a partial response. My partner was exasperated when we would receive, by snail mail, three copies of the same result. Other times, the results never came.,When people ask me what I'm going to do now that I've retired from my practice, I have a simple answer: Not that.,is a German word meaning the satisfaction of checking things off a list. In my case, solving one problem seemed to branch into several more, until it became clear that I'd rarely — if ever — get to the ,part. The frustrations of a disjointed system and the difficulty of dealing with a disproportionate number of people with mental health disorders replaced the joy I felt when I started my practice.,I even developed a phobia of taking vacations — the thought of work piling up ruined any benefit that would come from a much-needed break.,Toward the end, I finally managed to stop people from asking their umpteenth question, realizing that if I didn't hear it, I would not be responsible to answer. This must be how my colleagues stay afloat, and I have a lot of respect for them. But for me, it was too late.,From a young age, my daughter, Kassaundra, wanted to become a vet. I strongly advised her against studying medicine, let alone becoming a family doctor. Imagine my surprise when she told me she was applying to medical school.,Now that she's a medical resident, I have the considerable honour of nudging her away from the pitfalls of our profession and toward the joys of managing a fulfilling practice.,Perhaps I will recruit the amazing IT talent in Quebec and its dedicated doctor community to try my hand again at building smart tools for Kass, her colleagues and the rest of us patients in this province.,But what I do know is that for Kass and my other children — William, 11, Nikki, 8, Anthony, 7, and Sarah, two-and-a-half — I'm here.,Now, you've got my full attention."
COVID-19 vaccines in national stockpile starting to expire as uptake slows,"Health Canada says almost 1.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines held in a national inventory have expired since January.,That includes more than 420,000 doses of Moderna's Spikevax that hit the end of their shelf life on Tuesday. Those doses had already seen their expiration date pushed back two months.,The government says this is a relatively new issue because dose deliveries were aligned with demand until late last year. But uptake of vaccines has slowed even as governments and public health authorities urge people to get a booster shot.,More than 80 per cent of Canadians are considered fully vaccinated, while 57 per cent of adults and 15 per cent of teenagers have received a third dose.,Some provinces are extending fourth doses to high-risk populations as well, and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization this week issued more urgent advice for younger adults and teens to get their third dose as the sixth wave of COVID-19 keeps growing.,Still, uptake is significantly lower than it has been, falling from a peak of 600,000 doses a day in June, to 250,000 in January, and about 30,000 daily over the last month.,So far less than two per cent of Canada's COVID-19 vaccine supply has expired, though that number doesn't include doses that expired after being shipped to provinces and territories.,Last fall, a Canadian Press survey of provincial governments on wasted doses found at least 120,000 doses sent to provinces had expired, but the data didn't include numbers from Ontario, which refused to respond to the question.,Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease expert at the University of British Columbia, said losing some doses to expiration is normal in vaccine campaigns.,""You're distributing a good to all parts of the country with varying uptake rates and varying desires for a specific product during that process, so some products will meet their expiry date,"" he said.,Canada has only donated 15 million of the 38 million doses it promised to share from its own supplies, but demand for those has also fallen this year. The COVAX vaccine sharing alliance distributing most donations has slowed its requests in recent weeks as supplies exceeded the ability of countries to get doses into arms.,Murthy said Canada should have done more earlier to facilitate vaccinations in lower-income countries by supporting changes to licensing laws and manufacturing so the vaccines could be made in more places.,Those changes are now in the works but Murthy said it shouldn't have taken two years for that to happen.,Canada now has 18 million doses in its national stockpile and the vast majority will expire within the next four months. That includes 4,200 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that run out of time at the end of April, more than 900,000 doses of the pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that expire in June, and 3.1 million doses from a recent shipment of the new vaccine from Novavax that expire at the end of August.,Almost 5.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adults and teenagers will expire in July and August. Another 8.2 million doses of Spikevax expire between May and October.,Provinces and territories still have between 10 and 12 million doses in their own stockpiles.,Health Canada said in a written statement that it's working to manage doses to limit expirations, including donating when possible and working with manufacturers to see if expired doses can still be used safely.,Health Canada has revised expiration dates multiple times in the last year, as the companies that make the vaccines were able to get better data on how long the vaccines remained viable.,Pfizer's shelf life was extended from six months to nine months last summer, and Moderna's from seven months to nine months in December."
B.C. declared overdose deaths a public emergency 6 years ago. Advocates say the only change is the body count,"John Hedican is disgusted.,His son Ryan's life was cut short at age 26 when Ryan overdosed on fentanyl in 2017. At that point, the B.C. government had already declared a public health emergency due to the opioid crisis.,Now, six years since that emergency was declared, an average of six people are dying daily and a total of 9,400 lives have been lost to illicit drug toxicity in the province.,In that time, Hedican says, he has seen politicians mobilize to combat COVID, fires, and floods, and he is left asking why the same coordinated government efforts were not made to save his son and so many others.,""It's just appalling. We got a mass killing in our country happening and we don't have politicians that have the spine to talk about what is needed to stop these preventable deaths,"" said Hedican, speaking Thursday on CBC's ,Hedican is one of countless advocates — including parents, health professionals and the B.C. Coroners' Service — calling for a safe supply of clean drugs to be made readily available to all substance users.,B.C. is the ,. According to the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, more than 12,000 people were dispensed prescribed safer supply between March 2020 and December 2021.,Last week, the , was launched by , in Vancouver. The enhanced access program began on April 7 with a single client.,But critics say the province's safe supply program is , because there are not enough prescribing doctors, the drugs are not strong enough, and not all users qualify for it.,""We wouldn't just talk about a small percentage of chronic alcohol users and come up with an alcohol replacement or a low barrier access for alcohol. We would clean up the supply of alcohol to protect all users,"" said Hedican.,The advocacy group Moms Stop The Harm is rallying across the province Thursday as they too try to get the safe supply program expanded.,""We're protesting the lack of progress the government has made in these six years,"" said co-founder Leslie McBain, who joined Hedican on ,""Safe supply is the only thing that is going to slow, and eventually, hopefully, stop the deaths."",A clean drug supply may have saved her son Jordan, 25, who died from an opioid overdose in 2014.,McBain says roughly every month, when the B.C. Coronors Service releases its latest illicit drug death overdoses, she hears the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Sheila Malcolmson respond with what the province is doing to help people recover from addiction, as opposed to helping people stay alive.,""Dead people don't recover,"" said McBain.,McBain says people often ask her what has changed since April 14, 2016 when the public health emergency was declared. Her response, she says, is that the death numbers have gotten worse.,Malcolmson, along with Premier John Horgan and Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry released a statement marking the anniversary today. It mentions that an all-party committee was created this month so all sides of the legislative assembly can work on the issue.,""Prior to the pandemic, we had made important progress on reducing the number of deaths in our province, but the toxicity of the supply has increased faster than we've been able to stand up new services,"" reads the statement in part. ,""We need to come together to protect British Columbians now and into the future. While we are making progress, we know there is much more to do."",Parents grieving across the province say they know exactly what needs to be done.,In Prince George, parents held a vigil outside the office of local MPs to raise awareness and demand a safe supply of drugs be made available.,""Kids need to learn from their mistakes, not die from them,"" said Michelle Miller, speaking Thursday on ,The Prince George mom lost her son, Tanner Miller, in 2019 to fentanyl poisoning.,Miller says the toxic drug crisis is not fuelled by addiction or drug misuse, but by a toxic drug supply.,""How many more of our sons and daughters have to die before enough is enough?"""
Why navigating your COVID risk is now harder than ever,"Figuring out where you're most at risk of catching COVID-19 is more challenging than ever in Canada's Omicron-fuelled sixth wave, and tried-and-tested strategies for avoiding infection are proving less effective in everyday life.,The rapidly spreading BA.2 subvariant has been evading all of our layers of protection — from vaccines to masks — and fuelling a surge of COVID-19 levels across Canada during a time of few restrictions.,But while attempting to avoid COVID-19 risk entirely isn't realistic, abandoning strategies that have worked to lessen the impact of the virus isn't either — making this phase of the pandemic incredibly difficult to navigate.,""We have not experienced what it's like to live with this virus while we are doing this little to stop it,"" said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Harvard Medical School instructor who recently wrote about ,. ,""Never until now have we been in a situation in which we have the least amount of protection against infection and these variants that are just flabbergastingly contagious."" ,Faust says because everyone has a different risk threshold in day-to-day life, trying to navigate the pandemic based on your presumed best interest is a ""dead end"" because many people are unlikely to have judged the situation correctly.,""We might be completely correct one day and be safe and be completely incorrect the next day and be either personally at risk or putting someone else at risk,"" he said. ""And it's this variability that makes your head spin if you stop to think about it."",Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases physician and associate professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said part of the problem with Omicron is that it punches through all our layered protections ""much more effectively than anything has before."",""All of those layers still reduce your risk, it's just that the assault on the layers is a lot more aggressive right now,"" she said. ""It's like there's a lot more shots on goal."",Saxinger said that even though , there is still a ""forest fire of COVID"" raging across the country, with transmission signals recently rising in ,, ,, ,, , and , despite limited testing.,""The risk of infection has gone up markedly over the past three months,"" said Erin Bromage, an associate biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who researches infectious diseases.,""And it's getting harder for those who have avoided infection up until now to continue avoiding infection."",Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said this week that average daily case counts, test positivity rates and wastewater signals are all signalling growing transmission across the country that requires the ""layering of precautions"" to drive infection rates down. ,""There is still a lot we can do to dampen down the current trajectory,"" she said during a press conference Wednesday. ,""We know that using personal protective measures like masking helps reduce transmission. Likewise getting a booster dose doesn't just protect you against severe illness, it also provides a level of protection against infection."" ,But the effectiveness of masking in preventing the transmission of Omicron and its highly contagious subvariants isn't perfect, and the protection against infection from boosters appears to be waning at a rapid rate.,Linsey Marr, a researcher on the airborne transmission of infectious diseases and a professor at Virginia Tech says that while masks have the same filtration level for any virus — our chance of infection could be higher with these more transmissible variants.,""One thing that might be different with the variants is that people could be shedding more virus into the air….  You're exposed to more virus, so your chances of infection are higher,"" she said. ""Another thing that might be different is that the infectious dose could be lower."" ,Marr said there seems to be a ""significant change"" with masks against Omicron and its subvariants, meaning a cloth mask that may have been somewhat protective before is no longer sufficient and that higher-quality masks may be necessary.,""The masks could help blunt it a little bit, but they weren't going to stop this wave or prevent this wave from happening,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician and member of Ontario's COVID-19 vaccine task force. ,""I'm very much in favour of indoor masking, I'm very much aligned with 'the mask mandate should not have been lifted,' but it would not have stopped or prevented this wave."",Additional booster doses of the vaccine are also beneficial in preventing severe disease across the population, but a large new , showed fourth-dose protection against infection waned after just four weeks. ,The observational study focused solely on adults aged 60 and older and found protection against severe illness didn't wane in the six weeks after a fourth dose, but the data was too limited to determine whether a second booster provided better long-term protection. ,""I'm not surprised that fourth doses aren't generating very durable protection against infection,"" said Dr. David Naylor, who led the federal inquiry into Canada's 2003 SARS epidemic and now co-chairs the federal government's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.,""Two shots were much more effective against Delta.  What's clearly changed is that two or even three shots won't preclude getting any of the substrains of Omicron."" ,Naylor said fourth doses make sense for elderly Canadians, the immunocompromised and those with comorbidities, adding that we should be cautious with Israeli data because of the different spacing of doses there and their sole reliance on the Pfizer vaccine.,""We also have lots more people now with hybrid immunity — one, two or three shots, plus an infection in the last few months that may be increasing their level of protection,"" he said. ,""It's a rapidly shifting playing field."",So while avoiding COVID-19 infection may not be feasible for most people, delaying it until you're as protected as possible has benefits — and there are still ways you can lessen risk. ,""To try and avoid infection, people still need to avoid indoor spaces that are crowded or that create close contact,"" said Bromage, who wrote a , in May 2020 shared by millions explaining the places people are most at risk of COVID-19 infection.,""When in those situations, people need to wear higher quality masks than they used previously — preferably N95 or equivalent — and limit the time in those spaces. Duration matters."" ,Increased immunity, broader availability of COVID treatments and two years' worth of knowledge among members of the medical community are also helping to ensure that when people do get sick, they're getting the best possible care.,It's still a crisis, but the situation in Canada and abroad is steadily improving, stressed Bogoch.,""I've spoken with people in their 80s, who are triple vaccinated, who got COVID… but who are going to recover from this infection without having to come to a hospital. That's amazing,"" he said. ,""Before the vaccines were available, many of these people would have gotten very sick, landed themselves in hospital, needed an intensive care unit and many would have died."" ,In Italy, one of the countries hard hit by COVID-19 early on in the pandemic — with one of the highest global death tolls — , vaccination efforts roughly halved the number of deaths.,Vaccines prevented some 150,000 fatalities last year, the country's National Health Institute (ISS) estimated on Wednesday, as well as more than 500,000 hospitalizations and over 55,000 admissions to intensive care.,Even though it's tough to avoid catching COVID, it's worth buying time if you can while the scientific community develops and approves drugs and treatments that could cut that risk even further, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious diseases fellow at Stanford University in Stanford, Calif. ,""The fact that they now have more knowledge in terms of how to treat COVID means that when they do have these big surges, there are tools that they can use to reduce the infection fatality rate,"" he said.,Just this week, , for preventing COVID-19 infections for immunocompromised individuals aged 12 and up. ,, an antiviral from Pfizer, which has been so far tough to access throughout Canada but can cut the risk of death when taken early in an infection.,""The most important thing is really focusing on, 'What can I do to reduce my risk of severe infection should I get infected?' And there you say, 'OK, am I maximally vaccinated? And am I someone who should get tested early in case I'm eligible for a treatment?'"" Saxinger said.,""And if you do get infected, rather than beating yourself up, make sure that you're accessing all the available things that would be helpful."" "

"Ontario's 6th COVID-19 wave may have crested, but impact of long weekend to be seen: modelling","COVID-19 levels in Ontario may have have crested amid a sixth wave of the pandemic but the impact of long weekend gatherings remains to be seen, says the province's science advisory table.,In a new report Thursday, the group says it's uncertain whether the current plateau in wastewater indicators will remain, be followed by an increase after the holidays or if cases will decrease.,Dr. Peter Jüni, who heads the science table, cautioned it is still too early tell if cases have fully peaked, warning that things may change — especially with Easter weekend coming up. ,""We do not know in which direction this will go ... it's very challenging to make any predictions."",The latest modelling suggests Ontario is ""well into"" the sixth wave of the pandemic, driven by new, more transmissible BA.2 subvariant, waning immunity and the relaxation of public health measures. Ontario reported 1,392 people in hospital with COVID-19 on Thursday, and 23 more deaths linked to the virus. Hospital occupancy is likely to continue to rise for some time, the group says.,Jüni says the latest wastewater data suggests daily case counts for the virus may have reached a plateau at around 100,000 new daily infections.,Virus-related infections among health-care workers are as high as they were during the Omicron wave, and that, combined with rising hospitalization numbers, may impact health-care capacity.,Masking in indoor areas will continue to substantially reduce the risk of getting and spreading the virus, the group added. ,The recommendation comes as Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters on Thursday he would be ""more than happy"" to extend remaining public health restrictions past the expected end date of April 27 if Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, recommends doing so.,Asked about the science table's expected modelling at an unrelated news conference Thursday, Ford said he was hearing ""positive"" things about wastewater, but encouraged people to remain cautious.,""If you're having 15 people over, put your mask on ... it doesn't hurt,"" Ford said, ahead of the holiday weekend.,""We've been through this for two years now, it's common sense."",The group noted that high infection rates, along with potentially high hospitalization rates, will impact the province's ability to provide care for non-COVID-19 patients. However, the peak of this wave will likely be lower than the one seen in January amid an Omicron-driven surge.,A spokesperson for Health Minister Christine Elliott said the projections on hospital and ICU occupancy shows that Ontario can manage the current wave of infections without changing its public health response.,""This confirms what Dr. Moore reaffirmed earlier this week — Ontario has the tools and capacity to manage this wave of COVID-19 without imposing additional public health measures or reinstating a mask mandate,"" Alexandra Hilkene said in a statement.,""Ontarians should stay up to date with their vaccines, including boosters, and speak to a heath-care provider about what treatment options are available."",Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at University Health Network in Toronto,said it's ""great to see"" infection levels plateauing and even declining in most regions in the latest wastewater data projections.,""The pace of hospitalization appears to be plateauing as well,"" Bogoch said in a tweet Wednesday.,""It's still early and there's a lot of COVID out there, but we may be headed out of this wave."",Meanwhile, today's hospitalizations mark a jump from Wednesday's 1,332 and 1,126 at this time last week.,Of the hospitalizations reported, there are 177 patients in intensive care. That's down from 182 a day earlier but up from 159 a week ago.

I'm a radio journalist who is passionate about sound. Now I'm losing my hearing,"It was a cool morning early last spring and I was interviewing a rancher about her concerns surrounding the upcoming wildfire season in the B.C. Interior. We walked through patches of snow and across a pasture of bunchgrass when we noticed a meadowlark sitting on a fence post. She commented on its beautiful song and we stood in silence as I held out my microphone to capture its voice. But as I turned up the volume on my recording device, I heard nothing.,The moment solidified something I'd long suspected: I am losing my hearing. And it marked the moment I started fearing the looming end of my vital link to the world I love — that of radio journalism.,For as long as I can remember, I've had a deep relationship with sound because I know how precious it is. Since childhood, I've been deaf in my left ear, a rare side effect from a commonplace infection. I miss a lot in casual conversation, and have learned to lip-read and manoeuvre my way through social settings as friends and family take part in choreographed dances to get on my ""right"" side. ,In part, that's what drew me to a career in radio. I spend my workdays with headphones on and when I'm out in the field, I gather sound with a shotgun microphone and control the volume closely. I can lose hours in the studio mixing and layering the audio, creating documentaries that bring stories to life for listeners.,I've developed a reverence for the sounds I've collected: the voices of the , of worship in a hospital chapel; the bellowing of cattle being moved up a mountain by a young woman ,; the deep voice of the former Chief of the Kwikwasut'inuxw Haxwa'mis First Nation , calling the scant run of sockeye salmon home. These recordings come layered with a range of human emotions, along with deep breaths, sighs, and awkward laughs that reveal as much as the words they punctuate., ,A few months ago, I visited an audiologist who confirmed my single-sided deafness. She also said the hearing in my right ear was mapped across the lowest point of the normal range and could continue to decline. She suggested a type of CROS system (contralateral routing of signal) hearing aid that would cost several thousand dollars.,I didn't pause a beat before saying, ""Yes,"" dreaming of not having to hunch over to hear my daughter's voice and hoping it would allow me to hear the world in all the depth I wanted.,But when I finally got fitted with hearing aids, the world didn't become crisp and clear. Instead, it was enveloped in static with sharp, tinny accents, as if I was sitting in an airplane ready for takeoff.,My audiologist told me my brain would get used to it and to come back for more adjustments. I walked out of her office altogether disoriented by the racket in my ears.,Over the past several months, I've been trying to get used to the new way things sound but it's exhausting. Although I'm more adept at catching conversation in small groups, it's a struggle to sort through the symphony of chaos that comes through my headphones when I'm out reporting. A voice no longer holds prominence over a set of keys jingling in a hand; the sound of my shoes walking on a sidewalk echoes back to me unnaturally.,This is changing my journalism, too, as I transition from audio to writing.,In radio, there's an intimacy that goes with hearing another person's voice or the quiet wash of the ocean directly in your ear. It can transport the listener to another world. Now, I'm trying to recreate these moments with words — the pauses and silences, the way the wind rustles through trembling aspens when the leaves are dry in the fall, or how with the first major snowfall there comes a sense of muffled stillness. My reverence for sound is still there, but I'm learning to express it differently. ,And just as losing the hearing in my left ear as a child made me appreciate the world of radio, coming to terms with its decline in my right has made me hold tight to all that I can still hear. I listen more carefully than ever, taking in the precious connections to the world around me."
"Fired for refusing to disclose COVID vax status, Manitoba man sues pharmaceutical giant Bayer","A Manitoba man is suing pharmaceutical giant Bayer, claiming he was fired for refusing to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19.,The lawsuit alleges the man's employment was terminated in January ""without just cause"" and in breach of his employment contract. CBC News is not naming the man because of personal health information.,He had worked for about 18 years at Bayer Inc., a company with divisions including pharmaceuticals and agriculture, operating in Germany, the United States and Canada, including Winnipeg.,He was a program manager and did his work entirely from home, both before and during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to his statement of claim filed April 7 at the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench in Winnipeg.,The lawsuit says his vaccination status for COVID-19 or any other disease was not among the terms of the employment contract. ,Bayer Inc. implemented the vaccination requirement unilaterally and made it effective January of 2022, the claim alleges.,""It was not a term of his employment contract that he had an obligation to disclose any personal health information,"" the claim says, adding the man sought an exemption from the policy but was denied.,Since he was working from home ""neither his employment duties nor the employment contract required in-person interaction with other employees of the defendant (Bayer Inc.), its customers or other stakeholders,"" the claim says.,The allegations have not been tested in court and Bayer has not yet filed a statement of defence. ,""Bayer is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment including reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection for employees,"" a company spokesperson said in an email to CBC News.,""As a life sciences organization, we believe in the effectiveness of vaccines. Vaccination against COVID-19 is a pillar of public health guidance and key to providing a safe working environment for all our employees and those with whom they come into contact."",Bayer said it would not comment further on matters related to litigation. The plaintiff's lawyer also declined comment. ,Toronto labour and employment lawyer Lior Samfiru, who is not involved with the case, says his firm has represented clients across Canada whose jobs have been affected by their vaccination status.,""I can tell you that that is one of the most common issues that employees have faced over the past six or seven months, which is dealing with their vaccination status and the impact of that status on their job,"" he said in an interview.,""A wrongful dismissal means that you are let go without compensation. So if he had been paid proper severance, it would not be a wrongful dismissal,"" Samfiru said. ,The lawsuit alleges the employer failed to compensate the man, and seeks an unspecified amount of money in general damages for wrongful termination. ,It also seeks aggravated and punitive damages for the manner in which he was dismissed, such as allegedly not giving him a positive letter of reference and demanding he disclose personal health information without a legitimate reason.,The employer demanded the man ""undertake personal health treatments, despite his vaccination status having no rational connection to his employment duties, and terminated his employment when he declined to do so,"" the court document says.,It says that as an employee working entirely from home, Bayer's demand that he disclose personal health information and the subsequent termination of his employment was contrary to the Manitoba Human Rights Code.,""If this employee actually works exclusively from home, it makes the situation that much more ridiculous,"" Samfiru said."

I know I had very mild symptoms for ,."",The premier said there was an ""extraordinarily"" high vaccination rate in B.C. and Canada, and he would get his fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine when the time came.,But he did not comment on a potential return of the indoor mask mandate, or other public health requirements like the vaccine passport.,""I've got my mask with me when I'm in a place to be concerned about those around me,"" he said. ""I think most Canadians are in that spot right now."",Horgan also asserted that there had been no outbreaks in schools when asked about B.C.'s ,.,""We're not seeing a lot of outbreaks in our K-12 system, and if they are, they've been mild,"" he said. ""Would we use some more money for better HVAC systems in our schools? Of course we could.,""But we're at a good point ... Be kind to each other, and wear a mask if you're uncomfortable."",Andrew Longhurst, a health policy researcher and PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University, said that a lack of provincial data collection makes it tough to assess Horgan's comments about how B.C. is doing in the pandemic.,B.C. scaled back much of its data collection about the pandemic, especially ,, in the months leading up to the fifth wave, and also recently changed , from COVID-19.  Now all deaths within 30 days of a positive test for the novel coronavirus will be counted, whether or not COVID-19 has been confirmed as an underlying cause of death.,Longhurst said the lack of high-quality data in recent weeks has left researchers relying on anecdotal evidence to analyze how B.C. is performing with respect to COVID-19.,""What I would say, very directly, is we do have wastewater surveillance data [in the Lower Mainland],"" he told CBC News. ""What it shows right now is that we are likely in an upward period — where we are seeing greater concentration of the virus picked up in wastewater.,Rolling average of <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#COVID19</a> wastewater measurements rose in four of five Metro Vancouver treatment plans in the last week. <br><br>Average is now 65-80% of what it was in the January peak, but you can see what the trendlines are currently doing. <a href=""https://t.co/EHMUAinCVv"">pic.twitter.com/EHMUAinCVv</a>,""I think that would challenge this idea that things are stabilizing."",Longhurst says B.C. is likely still in the trough between the fifth and sixth wave of COVID-19, a few weeks behind Ontario, , in recent weeks from the sixth wave.,He also pushed back on Horgan's claim that there are few outbreaks among children, saying that officials lack appropriate data to back it up, given the province stopped , since the fifth wave.,""Unfortunately, I get the sense that authorities don't actually want to collect the data,"" Longhurst said. ""In some ways it's better to not know what's going on. And that allows you to play dumb."",Longhurst said the lack of public health measures, especially the indoor mask mandate, is concerning given the potential debilitating effect , and , on peoples' immune systems.,""I will say that it's pretty clear … we have not reached 'herd immunity,' "" he said. ""And it's not going to be achieved, at least from what we're seeing.

"Wastewater samples in Sask. show COVID-19 spike in Regina, peak in Saskatoon","A scan of sewage sample in four Saskatchewan cities shows an exponential increase in COVID-19 in Regina and a decrease in some of the province's northern cities, according to wastewater analyses from the University of Regina and University of Saskatchewan.,The latest report from the University of Regina says current viral levels of SARS-CoV-2 are more than 250 per cent higher than peak levels during the Alpha wave in April 2021. That means there is 2.5 times more COVID-19 present in Regina, according to the study.,""Initial analyses indicate that the levels will not decrease within the next reporting period,"" a post on the University's Facebook page read.,""Compared to the previous week, the viral levels have increased significantly and remain high."",Wastewater data can help predict COVID-19 caseloads in Saskatchewan cities. Saskatchewan shifted from reporting daily COVID-19 data in early February to weekly reporting.,COVID-19 case numbers are skewed, even with weekly reporting, because of testing restrictions, making it difficult for experts and the public to track COVID-19 in the province.,In Saskatoon, analysis released by scientists from the university's Global Institute for Water Security on Monday found there was a 25.5 per cent increase in the COVID-19 viral load of Saskatoon sewage samples while that load dropped in Prince Albert and North Battleford.,It's a relatively small shift in Saskatoon's viral load of COVID-19, given the city's 742 per cent increase reported a week ago, however, toxicology professor John Giesy wrote in an email that Saskatoon is in ""uncharted "" territory.,He said the data runs almost exactly two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, meaning that the high rate of COVID-19 found in the University's wastewater analysis foreshadows a looming spike in hospitalizations.,""The current wave driven by Omicron BA-2 is still going up and we are now at the greatest value we have ever seen,"" he said.,""If there is any good news, the rate of increase seems to be slowing."" ,Both Prince Albert and North Battleford had a reduced COVID-19 viral load, with researchers calculating a 16.5 per cent decrease and 20.1 per cent decrease respectively.,Treatment plant operators in Prince Albert said that the average daily flows in the past week were about 16 per cent more than the last report because of meltwater — and the decrease needs to be read with that in mind.,Saskatoon, Prince Albert and North Battleford cities based their change percentage on the average of three individual daily measurements compared to the weekly average of the previous week. Reporting for this data in Saskatoon ended on April 13, Prince Albert on April 11 and North Battleford on April 9. ,In all four cities, the highly contagious Omicron BA.2 subvariant made up more than 98 per cent of the COVID-19 viral load found in sewage samples.,In the previous week's report, the subvariant made up less than 90 per cent of all samples found in Saskatoon, Prince Albert and North Battleford. Analysis in Prince Albert only found the BA.2 subvariant was in 61 per cent of the samples."
Ottawa to maintain mask requirement for travellers after U.S. drops rule: transport minister,"Transport Minister Omar Alghabra is giving no indication his government plans to drop its masking requirement for air and train passengers in Canada in the near future.,""We constantly consult our experts and whenever the advice that we receive changes because the circumstances change, we will change our regulation,"" he said Tuesday. ""But for now, it is what it is."",His comments came after a federal judge in Florida struck down a Biden administration requirement that passengers wear face coverings on airplanes and mass transit.,In her decision, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) failed to justify the mask mandate and did not follow proper regulatory procedures.,On Monday night, the Transportation Security Administration said it would no longer enforce the masking requirement. Airlines and airports across the U.S. swiftly began to repeal their masking requirements for passengers.,Taking a question from reporters in Calgary, Alghabra wouldn't comment on the U.S. decision but said the Canadian government bases its decisions on science and data.,""Masks are proven to provide additional layers of protection and we will continue to follow the advice of our public health experts,"" he said.,""I take no joy in these regulations except to know they are done to protect everyone's health and safety."",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked about his government's masking requirements during a press conference later in the day,. He largely echoed his transport minister's comments.,""People want to stay safe but they also want to get back to the things they love. And the best way to do that is to lean in on what the science is telling us, what the experts are telling us, and make sure we move forward in the right way,"" he said.,The federal government requires that passengers be fully vaccinated with , before boarding domestic or international flights departing from most airports in Canada. It also requires that passengers wear masks inside airports and rail terminals and while on board planes and trains.,A Canadian official — speaking on background because they were not authorized to speak on the record — said the government communicated with airline operators Monday night to say that Canada's mask requirements will still apply.,While a number of provinces have lifted their mask mandates, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam recommends that Canadians carry on masking in indoor settings.,""We are seeing that resurgence, whether you call it the sixth wave or however many waves there is in your local jurisdiction, it is a resurgence,"" she said ,.,""Wear a mask anyways, whether the province ... [or] local jurisdiction is recommending it or not."",The CDC recently extended the mask mandate — which was set to expire Monday — until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 Omicron subvariant of the coronavirus now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S.,""This is obviously a disappointing decision,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, speaking of the Florida court case.

Youth mental health organization needs volunteers to meet demand,"More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, one youth mental health organization is seeing no signs that the demand for their support will slow down — and they say they need more help themselves.,Kids Help Phone has about 1,600 volunteers available each month to answer calls and texts from kids across the country.,But to really meet the needs of the young people reaching out, the director of its clinical operations in Ottawa says they need more hands on deck. ,""We'd need probably about 2,000 volunteers active monthly. So we're looking for about 400 more active volunteers on a monthly basis,"" Sarah Benkirane said.,The national charitable organization offers 24/7 bilingual mental health support, both by text and phone calls, for young people in crisis. ,There are currently 270 volunteers in Ottawa helping out. But since schools and other pre-pandemic activities have resumed, the agency has seen a decline in the number of people signing up to help, Benkirane said.,""We're managing with the team that we have,"" said Benkirane. ""But we want to make sure that we have enough volunteers, that volunteers can take time off when they need to."",Before the pandemic started, Kids Help Phone was averaging about 1.9 million interactions each year. In 2021, it recorded 4.6 million.,Since March 1, 2020, around the time the pandemic started, the agency said it has had more than 17,000 ""texting interactions"" and taken more than 10,000 phone calls from people in Ottawa.,""The demand is definitely higher than before the pandemic,"" Benkirane said.,There are several reasons that youth are seeking mental health support in increasing numbers this year, said Dr. Gail Beck, clinical director of youth psychiatry with The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre. ,For one, when classrooms temporarily shut down in January due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, it took a toll on both students and families, Beck said.,""When they lost a lot of contact with their friends that they would have had in school, that was a particularly difficult period,"" she said.,Another reason is that more young people are absorbing distressing events in the world through outlets like social media, Beck said, and that's adding to the stress they're already feeling.,""We found that a lot of youth — and not just youth of Ukrainian descent — have been very upset by the war in Ukraine,"" Beck said. ""It really is making them very fearful."" ,Beck imagines that Kids Help Phone is experiencing a dwindling number of volunteers in part due to burnout. It's something she and other frontline workers have been familiar with over the course of the pandemic. ,""You can be resilient and you can endure for a period of time. But when the stress continues in one way or another, sooner or later, you need to take a break yourself,"" Beck said."
"Quebec, we know you're getting together this weekend. Here's how to try to stay COVID-free","More than two years and six waves later, it's safe to say Quebecers are fed up with this pandemic. ,And with the long weekend upon us, a lot of people will be planning to gather with friends and family, especially those who celebrate Easter and Passover.,After all, it's been a while since there's been a long weekend with so few COVID-19 restrictions in effect.,CBC News spoke with experts who shared tips on how to help limit the risk of infection during your weekend gatherings.,Indoor gatherings are allowed. After all, the province has lifted most pandemic restrictions. But this weekend's large get-togethers come with risk.,""People should consider minimizing unnecessary gatherings,"" said Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre.,""That, however, is not realistic, and perhaps even extreme."",Quebec just surpassed 2,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations this week for the first time since mid-February, when the province was recovering from an Omicron-fuelled fifth wave that pushed the health-care system to its limit.,And although PCR tests are not as available as they once were, Quebec still reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases on both Wednesday and Thursday.,No one can stop you from going to that big dinner party with 20 or 30 people, but experts say it's important to be prudent and mindful of others, especially those who are more vulnerable to the disease.,Experts agree that if you have any COVID-19 symptoms — no matter how mild — you should cancel your plans and stay home.,""If you're feeling symptomatic, don't push it,"" said Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious diseases specialist at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital.,""Don't put those around you at risk of getting exposed. Say, 'Thanks, sorry, I'm going to stay home,' and maybe order DoorDash or Uber or something like that."",Oughton says you should watch for symptoms such as a fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and body aches. ,On Wednesday, Dr. Luc Boileau, Quebec's interim public health director, said the province is also up against an unseasonal wave of influenza.,COVID-19 and the flu have several symptoms in common. Even if you have any doubts about what you have, Boileau urged people to stay home to avoid infecting others.,Although rapid antigen tests are not as effective in detecting COVID-19 as PCR tests are, they can be a useful tool. ,""If you don't have any symptoms, you should test yourself with a rapid test a few hours before the event, paying particular attention to swabbing your nose as well as either the inside of both cheeks or the back of your throat, on the sides,"" Vinh said.,Rapid tests can also come in handy for people who have recently tested positive for COVID-19 and no longer have symptoms. ,In any event, if you test positive, it is best to scrap those dinner plans.,Being vaccinated with at least three doses and ensuring that everyone around you this weekend has had three vaccine doses will go a long way toward limiting the spread of the virus, in case someone you are in contact with does have COVID-19, Vinh said.,People who have yet to receive their third doses — and that means 46 per cent of Quebecers  — are more exposed to the virus.,Good news. It's spring. ,Even though rain is in the forecast this weekend, it is still much more possible to gather with others outdoors than it would be in the middle of January.,""Ventilation is absolutely everybody's best friend,"" said Oughton. ""If the weather co-operates, and you can do some of your get-together outside, that's marvelous because, outside, people are naturally and relatively well-distanced, [and there's] lots of air circulation."",If you have to stay inside, then crack some windows open, and you should also think about masking up.,""Realistically, the likelihood of people wearing masks for an indoor gathering is low,"" said Prativa Baral, a Montrealer who is a PhD candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.,""But if there are people who are not vaccinated in your gathering, if there are people who are at higher risk because they are immunocompromised or for various other reasons, then I would still suggest that wearing a mask will reduce risk as well."",Baral also encourages people to lie low for a few days after a gathering to see if they develop symptoms. That way, if they do contract COVID-19, they avoid infecting others.,Given how much the virus could circulate, Baral says this weekend is a ""critical"" one that could influence the shape of the province's sixth wave over the next few weeks.,Although she points out that high vaccination rates — especially among Quebecers 60 and older — should help limit repercussions, she says it's important for people not to underestimate the virus.,""Everybody around me is getting COVID right now in Montreal, people who haven't had COVID in the last two years. So there's a lot of virus circulating around us,"" she said.,""Anything that we can do to add those layers of protection will be helpful."""
"More robust COVID-19 testing system needed in Canada, say experts","Experts say Canada needs to develop a robust system to detect COVID-19 activity in the absence of wide-scale PCR testing.,Since the onset of the Omicron variant, provinces and territories have scaled back access to gold-standard PCR testing, citing the lack of capacity to keep up with demand and the need to free up health-care resources.,Many people have since relied on results from rapid antigen tests, but they aren't as reliable at detecting the Omicron variant, nor are they reported and tracked the way PCR tests are. Experts say there needs to be a better way of informing people about COVID-19 activity in their communities.,Dr. Caroline Colijn, a mathematician and epidemiologist at Simon Fraser University, said there are currently ""too many infections"" in Canada to expand access to PCR tests to everyone to find out the true number of infections.,She said more robust programs could also be used to pick up other kinds of respiratory infections.,""And I suspect those are under development, but until they're developed, deployed, and results are publicly available, people will have trouble finding out what their risks are in their social group, in their community and in their workplace,"" she said.,""So then they'll have trouble having the information needed to inform their own choices, their own workplace or community policies."",Colijn said wastewater data is a really important source of information that can be publicly shared without compromising anyone's private medical data and can help communities understand the prevalence of COVID-19. But like PCR and rapid tests, she said it has its limitations.,She noted there are numerous factors that could change wastewater signals, such as rainfall, temperature and different variants leaving different amounts of sequencing in the water, resulting in less accurate COVID-19 case estimates.,Colijn said she anticipates an integrated system that would incorporate wastewater data, along with PCR and rapid test results, in a way that's designed to paint a more accurate picture of how much COVID-19 is in a population and inform people about the risk of contracting the virus.,""So we do need to think about how to get representative samples, and how to understand how many infections are out there,"" she said.,Dr. Dan Gregson, an infectious disease physician and medical microbiologist at the University of Calgary, said it would be reasonable to expand PCR testing access to certain settings like schools and long-term care homes in the event of an outbreak so they can make a decision on whether to close those institutions to prevent further transmission.,However, he said the average person can rely on wastewater data to assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 in their community since it's ""much more cost-effective"" and ""tells us similar information"" to PCR testing.,Dr. Peter Juni, scientific director of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said it's ""likely not sustainable"" to expand access to PCR testing to all symptomatic individuals again because of the high cost of the tests.,Juni noted that when PCR testing was available to all residents in Ontario, only somewhere between 30 and 45 per cent of infections were being detected because not everyone with the virus was getting tested. Some may have been asymptomatic, while others may not have had time to get tested, and still others may not have been getting tested early enough.,As for rapid antigen tests available in Canada, he said they have shown ""lower test performance"" when it comes to detecting the Omicron variant.,What's needed is a COVID-19 detection system that can use a random sample in a population ""to try to understand what's actually happening and which can be ramped up if needed,"" Juni said.,""If we see in wastewater, for instance, that infections start to increase, (then) we actually can really activate the system or extend it a bit, but it will be just a surveillance system that gives us enough situational awareness."""
Why COVID headaches can be hard to shake — and when you should worry,"For some people with COVID-19, the pain in their skull is so intense they consider a trip to the emergency room. ,For others, it might come in throbbing waves or feel like a constant mild ache; it could be gone within minutes of taking painkillers or still be there months later.,""My head felt like it would explode, and no medication was enough to make it better,"" said Ananda Pires, who fell ill in late December.,After two days during which she was barely able to move from her bed, the Guelph, Ont., woman said her headache mostly disappeared, with just minor pain and sensitivity to light in the days that followed.,While loss of smell, fever and dry cough may be more publicized symptoms of COVID-19, headache is a common one, too. And, two years into the pandemic, patients and physicians are beginning to recognize that, for some, it may be by far the worst symptom — and one that lingers after others are gone.,It's why there's been ,, to study the little-understood long-term neurological symptoms reported in some acute COVID-19 patients, which can include headaches, brain inflammation and damage to brain blood vessels.  ,While some people's headaches disappear alongside the illness, other patients can't seem to shake them — even long after their other COVID symptoms are gone. ,Dr. Nili Kaplan-Myrth tested positive for COVID at the start of April. The Ottawa family physician is now well enough to resume seeing patients, but she still has an incessant headache that she describes as ""like a vise."",""It's like you're wearing a hat that's too small,"" Kaplan-Myrth told CBC News. ""It's a dull pain that's just always there."",For Scott Schmidt, the COVID headache ""was like living under water for a few weeks,"" with a constant pressure behind his eyes.,""I was like, I just cannot shake this headache for the life of me. I became used to it. I honestly just started going about my day with a headache,"" Schmidt, a journalist from Medicine Hat, Alta., said.,Headaches are common to viral infections, including colds and flu. They are often one of the earliest symptoms of COVID-19, which, physicians have noticed, can make it difficult to distinguish whether it's just a headache — or a sign of a developing illness.,Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious disease specialist in Mississauga, Ont., says he's seen patients present at emergency rooms with a severe headache and then test positive for COVID. ,But others might brush off a minor headache and not realize they're infected.,""So many people come and tell you, 'You know what? It was so weird, I had a little bit of headache, a little bit of a sore throat, I just thought I drank too much wine, but I was positive.'"",Chakrabarti said if someone develops a new headache in the middle of a rising wave of COVID, it's worth taking a rapid test.,He also points out that a sudden, severe headache can also be indicative of other medical emergencies, like a brain bleed, stroke or viral meningitis — some symptoms of which can be similar to those of COVID.,""If you're having a massive headache and a high fever, it's also a good idea to go to the emergency [room]. If you're having a bad headache and vomiting that won't stop, you go in as well."",For some people, the headache just won't go away — long after they're no longer infected. Exactly why isn't yet well understood.,""There are multiple possibilities at this point, and I don't think we have a good handle on it yet,"" says Dr. Jennifer Frontera, a neurology professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who is researching post-COVID conditions.,Some of those possibilities, she says, include complications from severe COVID, autoimmune conditions, high blood pressure impacting blood vessels in the brain, or even pandemic stress that results in tension headaches.,Given the number of potential causes, she says, ""it's worth going to a clinician and seeing what the treatment strategies are."",The good news is that most long COVID patients respond to existing treatments for headaches and migraines, says Dr. Angela Cheung,,.,Those treatments can include prescription medications, massage and mindfulness, depending on the diagnosis.,Cheung also reminds patients who despair about their long COVID symptoms that ""it doesn't mean that you will have this forever."" ,Her advice: ""Trying to deal with what you're currently experiencing one step at a time, because we are learning so much every day with COVID."",Though Kaplan-Myrth is still struggling through her daily headache, the Ottawa physician also has another worry: if she gets reinfected in future, will the headache return?,""The fear that I could get COVID again and go through this again, particularly when I'm not back to baseline as it is, is just like, I don't think I would cope,"" she said.,It's a concern shared by Schmidt, whose COVID headache finally went away after about three weeks.,""Now I actually live in just a tiny little bit of fear … Before, I was being careful because I pay attention and people told me to be careful,"" she said. ""Now I'm being careful, because I'm actually legitimately concerned for myself."""
"Ontario reports 1,301 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 3 more deaths after Easter long weekend","Ontario is reporting 1,301 people hospitalized with COVID-19 on Monday after the province's pandemic advisory table said late last week that ,, but that the Easter long weekend could change that.,The Ministry of Health did not release COVID-19 data on Easter Sunday. Hospitalizations that day reached 1,290, however it's important to note that upwards of 10 per cent of hospitals did not provide data.,The number of patients in intensive care has passed 200 for the first time since March 16. ,Of those hospitalized currently, 202 are in ICUs — up from 197 on Sunday. There are 91 patients with the virus who require the use of ventilators to keep breathing.,Ontario reported another 2,219 COVID-19 cases through limited PCR testing Monday, with 2,450 reported the previous day.,According to the science table's latest modelling published last Thursday, daily case counts for the virus may have reached a plateau at around 100,000 new daily infections.,Dr. Peter Jüni, who heads the science table, cautioned last week it is still too early to tell if cases have fully peaked amid this wave of the virus.,The ministry says 10,060 tests were completed Sunday. Test positivity rate sits at 18.7,per per cent.,The province also logged three more deaths linked to the virus — one logged Sunday and two on Monday — bringing Ontario's total COVID-19 death toll to 12,632.,Here are some other key pandemic indicators and figures from the ,:,: 35,500., 3,418., 136.,:,5,699 vaccine doses were administered on Sunday in Ontario, with a total of 32,397,809 given out to date.

"Record 417 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Saskatchewan, 22 more deaths reported","COVID-19 hospitalizations in Saskatchewan have reached a new all-time high, with 417 people in hospital with the disease as of Wednesday, provincial figures show.,The province's previous COVID hospitalization record was 410 in mid-February. Thursday's update also showed there were 39.5 COVID-like illness patients per 1,000 emergency department visits, an increase from the previous six weeks of reported data (34.2 per week/1,000 visits).,Hospitals across the province are experiencing capacity issues, especially in emergency departments, the Saskatchewan Health Authority previously confirmed to CBC News.  ,Emergency department doctors in Saskatoon and Regina say that patients ,, with fewer physicians available to take care of them.,Of those in hospital with COVID-19, 25 were in intensive care, the same number as the last weekly COVID report.,The province reported 22 new COVID deaths in Thursday's weekly update. Thirteen occurred within the week of April 10 to 16, and eight occurred in previous weeks (March 24 to April 9) but were reported this week, according to the province. There's no date yet for one of the deaths.,Three of the newly reported deaths were among people 69 years and younger. The rest were among those 70 years or older. Women made up almost 60 per cent of the deaths. ,There have been a total of 1,295 COVID-related deaths from March 8, 2020, to April 16, 2022, in Saskatchewan, according to the province. ,There were 18 confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities and care home settings in Saskatchewan reported between April 10 and 16.,The Saskatchewan government also announced on Thursday that a new COVID treatment option is available.,Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral that stops the virus from multiplying in cells and can reduce the likelihood of hospitalization, will be available on an outpatient basis.,People who are eligible for the treatment include those who are immunocompromised and adults who are not fully vaccinated.,""While Saskatchewan supports antiviral treatments for those most at risk for severe illnesses, they are not a cure and do not prevent COVID-19 transmission,"" the government wrote in a release.,""Vaccination remains the best tool available to prevent hospitalizations and death due to COVID-19."",Booster vaccinations in Saskatchewan have stalled. Since early February, the percentage of eligible people over 18 with at least their first booster dose has hovered around 50 per cent.,On Feb. 1, 48.56 per cent had at least one booster vaccination. In the data reported Thursday, it's at 51.7 per cent."
Pandemic deaths in New Brunswick found to be much higher than official government count,"New Brunswick recorded an estimated 423 deaths more than normal during an eight-week outbreak of the COVID-19 delta variant last fall, prompting questions about whether pandemic-related fatalities are being significantly underreported by the province's health officials.,Tara Moriarty says the answer is yes. ,""Most Canadian provinces missed or don't report at least half of [COVID deaths] historically, and New Brunswick is included in that,"" said Moriarty, who is an associate professor and infectious disease researcher at the University of Toronto.,Late last summer, after mask requirements were dropped in late July just as COVID-19's delta variant was circulating in the province, New Brunswick was hit with its largest outbreak of infections to that point.,In the eight weeks spanning early September to late October, the province registered 3,615 new COVID-19 cases and 70 deaths.,But new figures released by Statistics Canada last week as part of its ongoing ""excess mortality"" study of the pandemic show a record 1,583 people died in New Brunswick during that eight-week period.  ,That is 423 more than would have been ""expected"" in the absence of the pandemic, according to the agency.,Included in that group are 218 people under the age of 45 who died during the eight-week period, 171 more than normal.,""To understand the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, it is important to measure excess mortality, which occurs when there are more deaths than expected in a given period,"" Statistics Canada explains in material attached to the death counts. ,""There is evidence of excess mortality when weekly deaths are consistently higher than the expected number, but especially when they exceed the range of what is expected over several consecutive weeks."",The most deaths New Brunswick has ever recorded in the months of September and October in any year is 1,282. That was in 2019, but includes 61 days. ,Eight weeks cover only 56 days, which is why the 1,583 deaths documented by Statistics Canada were calculated to be 423 above normal for that time of year.,Moriarty is the lead author of a study on COVID-19 mortality in Canada published last year. In an interview this week she said it is not statistically plausible for New Brunswick to have suffered only 70 COVID deaths in September and October if total deaths in the province were more than 400 above normal numbers.,She cites inadequate testing for COVID in New Brunswick, which ranked lowest among provinces throughout the pandemic, for likely missing dozens of COVID infections and deaths.,""New Brunswick really does under-test a lot for the size of its epidemic compared to the Canadian average, so New Brunswick, simply by the scale of testing that it does, likely misses at least half of its COVID deaths,"" said Moriarty.,Other provinces have had significant  ""excess"" mortality counts as well, but few have had such large gaps between those and official provincial COVID death counts.,According to Statistics Canada, Saskatchewan was found to have had 406 more deaths than normal during same eight-week September-to-October period in which New Brunswick had 423, but it originally reported 240 COVID deaths to New Brunswick's 70.,Statistics Canada notes some of the upswing in deaths caused by COVID but not counted by provinces can be caused indirectly by issues like ""delayed medical procedures"" or ""increased substance use."",But Moriarty said her research shows that in most cases, COVID deaths go unrecognized, particularly in those who are never tested.,""Many people do die at home and because people who die are more likely to have, for example, diabetes or kidney disease or some other underlying feature, it's also quite common for it to be assumed that the death was due to those factors and not necessarily to COVID,"" she said.,""It's very complicated. Some of it is COVID that's simply not recognized, but a lot of it is COVID where it looks and smells like COVID, and it probably is COVID, but the postmortem testing is never done.""   ,CBC News asked New Brunswick's Department of Health to provide any information that supports or disputes the claim that 423 more people than normal died in the province last September and October. The request was acknowledged but there has yet to be a response.,However, Statistics Canada says its ""death counts"" come from ""provincial and territorial vital statistics registries."" ,New Brunswick initially led the country in reduced mortality during the pandemic, reporting 452 fewer deaths in 2020 than normal.,That changed in 2021. Beginning in September, New Brunswick's weekly excess death counts were, for its population, the highest among provinces.  ,No data past October has been posted yet for New Brunswick. "
First 3 deaths reported in Shanghai's current COVID-19 outbreak,"Shanghai authorities on Monday reported the first COVID-19 deaths in the latest outbreak in China's most populous and wealthiest city.,All three people who died were elderly, had underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and had not been vaccinated against the coronavirus, city Health Commission inspector Wu Ganyu told journalists.,""After entering hospital, their conditions grew worse and they died after attempts to save them were unsuccessful,"" Wu said.,The deaths raise to 4,641 the number of people that China says have succumbed to the disease since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019.,While China has an overall vaccination rate of around 90 per cent, a low rate among the elderly remains a concern. Only 62 per cent of Shanghai residents over age 60 have been vaccinated, according to the latest data available. Some experts say China needs to raise that rate before it can safely live with the virus.,While highly contagious, the omicron BA.2 variant driving the Shanghai outbreak is less lethal than the previous Delta variant. However, China's low death toll from COVID-19, which is blamed for more than 988,000 deaths in the United States, has raised questions about how China's authoritarian and often highly secretive government counts such fatalities.,Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are being confined to their homes for a third week as China continues to employ a ""zero-tolerance"" strategy to curb the outbreak, demanding isolation of anyone possibly infected.,China on Monday said 23,362 people had tested positive for the virus over the previous 24 hours, most of them showing no symptoms and almost all of them in Shanghai.,The city has reported more than 300,000 cases since late March. Shanghai began easing restrictions last week, although officials have warned that the city doesn't have its outbreak under control.,Shanghai, which is home to China's biggest port and most important stock exchange, appeared unprepared for such a massive undertaking.,Residents have run short of food and other daily necessities while enduring lockdown conditions, and tens of thousands of people put under medical observation have been sequestered in crowded facilities where lights are always on, garbage bins overflow, food is inadequate and hot showers nonexistent.,Anyone who tests positive but has few or no symptoms is required to spend one week in a quarantine facility.,Concerns have risen about the economic impact of the government's hardline policy.,China's economic growth edged up to a still-weak 4.8 per cent over a year earlier in the first three months of 2022 as lockdowns cut production in major industrial cities. Official data showed growth accelerated from the previous quarter's four per cent.,At a meeting Monday, Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, pledged increased spending to stabilize supply chains and provide financial support for health workers and others on the pandemic front lines.,While the ruling Communist Party has urged more targeted prevention measures, local officials have routinely adopted stringent regulations, possibly for fear of being fired or penalized over outbreaks in their areas.,In the city of Wenzhou, which has seen only a handful of cases, authorities have authorized rewards of up to 50,000 yuan (about $9,922 Cdn) for information about people who falsify their health status, online news site The Paper reported."
"Amber Heard has been 'living and breathing this lie for years,' Johnny Depp's lawyers tell libel trial","A trial over libel allegations by Johnny Depp against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, will likely turn into a six-week, mudslinging soap opera, Heard's lawyers warned a Virginia jury Tuesday.,""You're going to see who the real Johnny Depp is — behind the fame, behind the pirate costumes,"" Heard's lawyer, J. Benjamin Rottenborn, told the jury during opening statements in the civil trial. ""Because Johnny Depp brought this case, all of this is going to come out."",Depp sued Heard for libel in Fairfax County Circuit Court after she wrote an , in 2018 referring to herself as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse."",Depp says the article indirectly defames him by referring to ,. Depp denies abusing her.,In Tuesday's opening statements, Rottenborn said the evidence will show that Depp physically and sexually assaulted Heard on multiple occasions. But he told jurors that they don't need to make themselves referees of the couple's turbulent marriage if they focus on the basics of libel law.,He argued that Heard was exercising her First Amendment rights as an advocate when she wrote the article, which focused largely on the broad topic of domestic violence.,He also said the 2018 article did nothing to damage Depp's reputation. He noted that the abuse accusations had been public for two years already, and he said Depp's spiralling career was the result of his drinking and drug use, which made him an unreliable commodity to Hollywood studios.,""This man's poor choices have brought him to this point,"" he said. ""Stop blaming other people for your own self-created problems."",More than anything, though, he pointed out that the article in question never even mentions Depp's name.,Depp's lawyer, Benjamin Chew, acknowledged that Depp's name never appears in the piece.,""It didn't have to,"" Chew told the jury. ""Everyone in Hollywood knew exactly what she was talking about."",Depp's team argues that the article is an example of ""defamation by implication."" In the December 2018 piece, Heard wrote that ""two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out."",Chew said that's a clear reference to a restraining order Heard sought in May 2016 — right after Depp told her he wanted a divorce — in which she claimed she'd been physically abused.,Chew said she showed up at the courthouse on May 27 of that year with a bruise on her face that was photographed by the paparazzi. But he said the evidence will show that Heard gave herself the injury to ruin Depp's reputation. He said that Depp and Heard hadn't seen each other since May 21: he'd gone on a European tour with his band, the Hollywood Vampires.,Police and others saw Heard immediately after May 21 and her face wasn't bruised, Chew said. He said a witness will testify that he saw security footage in which Heard's sister throws fake punches at her, and the two laugh.,Another of Depp's lawyers, Camille Vasquez, told the jury that Heard refuses to admit she lied and has now dug in even deeper.,""She can't back down. She has been living and breathing this lie for years,"" Vasquez said. ""She's going to give the performance of a lifetime in this courtroom."",Both Depp and Heard are expected to testify at the trial, scheduled for six weeks, along with actors Paul Bettany and ,.,About 80 people, mostly Depp supporters, sat in the courtroom Tuesday. Some people lined up hours early for seats, but several rows were largely vacant.,The courtroom went silent a few minutes before the 10 a.m. start time when Heard entered the room, through a special entrance usually reserved for the judge. But there was an audible intake of breath when Depp came in a minute later, again through a special entrance.,A civil jury of seven members, plus four alternates, was selected Monday to hear the case.,Heard's lawyers had sought to have the case tried in California, where the actors reside. But a judge ruled that Depp was within his rights to bring the case in Virginia because The Washington Post's computer servers for its online edition are located in the county. Depp's lawyers have said they brought the case in Virginia in part because the laws here are more favourable to their case."
"Pandemic, violent crimes and overdoses drive up demand for autopsies in Manitoba","Demand for autopsies in Manitoba has risen 20 per cent over the past two years as a combined result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a spike in violent crime and rising numbers of fatal overdoses.,Forensic pathologists in Manitoba now conduct about 1,800 autopsies a year, up from 1,500 annually two years ago, Manitoba Shared Health said in a statement.,This is partly because of the pandemic, as more people are dying at home instead of in hospitals and therefore require forensic investigations to determine the cause of death, Shared Health said.,A rise in drug-related deaths is also fuelling the demand for autopsies, the provincial health organization said, as is ""a higher incidence rate of police cases in recent months, which are prioritized over other autopsies."",A record 407 Manitobans died of overdoses or other drug-related causes in 2021, the province disclosed earlier in April.,The rise in demand has exacerbated a backlog in conducting autopsies, Shared Health added, noting staff absences due to COVID-19 infections and vacations are also a factor in delays that will take two to three weeks to clear.,The delay in notifying grieving family members about the cause of death can be far longer, especially for people who died of fatal overdoses, said Arlene Last-Kolb, founder of Overdose Awareness Manitoba and a board member of the national advocacy group Moms Stop The Harm.,""Families are waiting anywhere from a year to a year and a half,"" said Last-Kolb, who lost her own son to an overdose in 2014 and speaks on behalf of other grieving parents.,""We might have an idea that a child or loved one has passed from an overdose, but we won't know for certain what caused that overdose."",Last-Kolb said the timely performance of autopsies is not just important for the purpose of providing families with closure. The province needs to know how many overdoses are occurring in order to formulate the proper policy response, she said.,Her group has been lobbying the province to ensure people who use non-medical drugs have access to a safe supply, free of highly toxic chemicals such as fentanyl.,Shared Health said it has hired two more forensic pathologists to help draw down the autopsy backlog — one to fill a vacant position and the other to bring the total complement up by one position, to seven pathologists in total.,The province has also hired a new autopsy technical assistant and is training another, Shared Health said."
"Amber Heard had fits of rage, Johnny Depp a 'Southern gentleman': actress's former assistant","A former personal assistant to Amber Heard said she never saw the actress suffer any physical abuse at the hands of then-husband Johnny Depp — but she said Heard once spit in her face when she asked for a higher salary.,Heard descended into screaming fits of blind rage, sent incoherent text messages at 4 a.m. and was often drunk and high on illegal drugs, Kate James testified in a video deposition that was played in court on Thursday during the trial for Depp's libel suit against Heard.,Depp, on the other hand, was very calm, almost shy, ""like a total Southern gentleman,"" James said.,The , actor has accused Heard of indirectly defaming him in a 2018 opinion piece that she wrote for ,. Heard refers to herself in the article as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse."",The piece doesn't name Depp. But his lawyers argue that it clearly refers to a restraining order that Heard sought in May 2016, right after Depp told her he wanted a divorce.,Depp denies abusing Heard, but Heard's lawyers say evidence will prove that he did.,The actor's denials, they argue, lack credibility because he frequently drank and used drugs to the point of blacking out and failing to remember anything he did.,The video testimony from James offered an inverse view: Depp was the peaceful one, she said, while Heard was frequently intoxicated and verbally abusive, including to her own mother and sister.,""Her poor sister was treated like a dog that you kicked, basically,"" James said.,James, who worked for Heard from 2012 to 2015, said she was paid ""very poorly."" She said she was hired with an initial salary of $25 an hour and that her duties ranged from picking up Heard's dry cleaning to talking with the actress's Hollywood agents.,James said she was also tasked with picking up two copies of any magazine that featured Heard and storing them in the garage to prevent Depp from seeing them. Heard went into a ""blind rage"" when James failed to place the magazines in the garage, James said.,Regarding Heard and Depp's time together, James said Heard was a ""very dramatic person"" who was deeply insecure in the relationship. Heard often called James to cry and complain about Depp, she said.,""I remember one time she called me when she was alone in New York City, and she was crying and walking around the streets,"" James said. She said she told Heard to go inside: ""I was worried that the paparazzi might take a photo of her."",Part of the deposition focused on a text message that Depp had sent to James after he and Heard split up. Depp's text read: ""Come over for a spot of purple and we'll fix her flabby ass nice and good."",A lawyer asked if ""spot of purple"" meant wine and whether ""her"" meant Heard. James said she didn't want to speculate.,""This is the way he writes,"" James said of Depp. ""It's very random and you don't sort of question it.... He writes in a very abstract way."",Both Depp and Heard are expected to testify at the trial in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia, scheduled for six weeks, along with actors Paul Bettany and James Franco and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk."

Understudies nab starring role in keeping theatres open amid Omicron,"Travis Seetoo didn't have his phone on him. He was out on a bike ride and happened to pull into the grounds of the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont., when he got grabbed by a stage manager. ,""She's like, 'You're on!'"" Seetoo recalls.,Just like that, Seetoo was ready to act — called up as an understudy for a show last year after another actor started showing COVID-19 symptoms. Seetoo said it was the first instance of a Shaw actor getting called up because of that. You aren't allowed to come to work at Shaw if you have any symptoms.,As Ontario theatre companies start their seasons amid a sixth wave of COVID-19, the odds of this happening have increased — and so has the reliance on understudies. Shaw is having members of its company understudy more roles this year because of the Omicron variant.,""It could happen at any time now,"" said Seetoo, acting in two shows at Shaw this season and understudying an additional five roles in those two plays. ""You certainly run your lines a lot more. You try not to forget them."",Often times, understudies are in the show already, playing another character or part of the ensemble.,Stratford Festival has hired more actors this season and also has more understudies than usual. It was set to start previews of the musical , last week, its first show of the season.,But three performances were cancelled after eight cast members tested positive for COVID-19.,Shows were able to resume Tuesday, with understudies replacing two roles.,Alex Mustakas is currently in the casting process, paying much more attention to hiring understudies, particularly for his musicals.,He's artistic director for Drayton Entertainment, which is putting on 15 different shows in six venues around southern Ontario this season, in places like Drayton and St. Jacobs near Kitchener-Waterloo and Grand Bend on Lake Huron.,""Understudies are the heroes of live theatre,"" he said. ""The alternative is no theatre and I don't think that's an option anymore."",Still, Mustakas worries. His son and wife contracted COVID-19 recently and he had to isolate at home. He spent all that time thinking what would happen if he were putting on a show right then. Drayton's season doesn't start until late May.,Then there's the cost. Understudies are an added expense, often out of reach for smaller theatre companies with tighter budgets, or shows have smaller casts. There are understudy rehearsals that need to be run, hard to do if the show is only on for a short stint or has a short rehearsal period.,But cancelling performances means losing a lot of money. Mustakas has budgeted for it this season. Mirvish Productions in Toronto doesn't do shows without understudies.,""To lose a performance is a very, very, very bad thing,"" said John Karastamatis, Mirvish's director of communications and programming. ""When you hire understudies and everything that goes with them, what you are buying is insurance."",Mirvish is in rehearsals for ,, the mega 3-hour and 30-minute, Tony Award-winning play, opening in Toronto at the end of May. It was initially ,To avoid any shutdown, Karastamatis said, each part in the show has two understudies, more than they've had before. It also means additional costs, like more costumes to fit those understudies. In the regular cast alone, the show has more than 500 costumes.,Shaw Festival had to ,in December during the first Omicron wave, after someone in the company tested positive. It's learned from that experience, especially about the importance of masks.,Actors keep masks on in rehearsal and a mask mandate is in place for the audience until at least May 23, even though the province doesn't require it. If an actor tests positive, the stage manager has to figure out if others in the show are at risk of exposure. That's a possibility, of course, as actors are maskless when they do shows.,Shaw's lone show that's on right now, ,, has not had to cancel any performances yet.,Kimberley Rampersad, Shaw's associate artistic director, said understudies are already being called upon for other shows in rehearsal right now. She calls them ""immeasurable."",""Our understudies will go on because COVID is what it is,"" said Rampersad, who this season is also acting in a show and directing/choreographing another. ""They will and have already saved us from cancelling shows."",It's also meant a shift in mindset for actors, used to not missing a show regardless of ailments. Seetoo, now in his eighth season at Shaw, has heard his share of horror stories.,""There used to be a great amount of pride [that] more senior actors have, in like, 'Oh I went on and I was bleeding from my solar plexus the whole time, and I did the best Hamlet you've ever seen,'"" he said.,Seetoo is glad COVID-19 has changed that.,""We have the same motivation which we used to have that we'd go on no matter what's happening,"" he said. ""We're still doing that, but we're staying home because we want the show to continue."""

Simple Plan launches fundraiser for children in Ukraine with new music video,"When members of Simple Plan sat down to brainstorm concepts for a music video earlier this year, it was hard to ignore one idea that was staring right back at them in Ukrainian filmmaker Jensen Noen.,Several months earlier, the Montreal pop-punk band had formed a friendship with the Los Angeles-based director who shot their videos for ,and,. As they planned a third for the single ,, Ukraine was slipping into a humanitarian crisis as Russia invaded the country.,Drummer Chuck Comeau said the band ended up in conversations with Noen about the troubling circumstances in his homeland and ways they could draw something hopeful from the war.,""This could be a really powerful music video,"" Comeau said they considered of the project, which premiered online Tuesday.,""(We) started to think, 'Maybe we can use the song.

And not long after, the director was pouring through his Ukrainian cast and crew contacts in the Los Angeles area, seeking people who might be interested in donating their time to create a music video that would double as a UNICEF fundraiser to help those at home.,By late March, a cast of Ukrainian actors had joined a small crew to tell the story of a Ukrainian family — a father on the battleground, a mother helping the wounded and exercising free speech and children caught in the crossfire.,Simple Plan appears in scenes intercut with the storyline, performing their song amid the ruins of a devastated region.,""The whole idea for us was really trying to have an antiwar message,"" Comeau said.,""We wanted to be very mindful of not telling a story that is not ours and not doing it in a way that could feel clumsy. But I think having Jensen on board, and with him having that personal connection, it felt like this was the right thing to do right now."",It was very special to see all this talented Ukrainian team come together for this cause &amp; create such a moving, emotional music video.

"Russian Doll Season 2 is a messy, but fascinating, sequel to Netflix's best show","Really, the impact of ,'s first season can't be understated. ,The show was a smash hit, gained wide critical acclaim, and became an Emmy winner all on the strength of a script that didn't seem to follow any conventional guidelines. The trippy, mind-bending narrative challenged what stories TV can tell, performed as one of the most successful Netflix series ever and landed its long-suffering creator Natasha Lyonne squarely in the spotlight. ,But when I spoke to her, she was only concerned with one thing.,""As you know,"" she said after I pointed out we were speaking on a Thursday, calling out a ,, ""I'm only in it for the memes."",<a href=""https://t.co/lK2BhEspvM"">pic.twitter.com/lK2BhEspvM</a>,She was speaking ahead of the premiere of Season 2 — a perhaps unnecessary, though expertly executed followup to the genre-defying original — and I was giddy. That's because talking to Lyonne is pretty much like talking to ,'s Nadia — the same raspy-voiced, acerbic character on the show she conceived, wrote, directed and starred in. ,And the experience talking to Nadia is something anyone who watched back in 2019 can imagine: she's hilarious, wickedly smart, incisive and just the right amount of confusing. ,It's a particular blend that, three years ago, produced one of the best and strangest things on TV, and on Wednesday, a sequel: a second season that does everything to continue the exceptionally well-realized characters that originally drew audiences in, but with an expanded scope and looser focus that causes the wheels to wobble. ,It's an interesting followup to the original about then-36-year-old Nadia, a freelance software developer who refuses to keep her cat indoors as she doesn't ""believe in dictating the boundaries of a sentient being's existence."" ,She then spends her birthday repeatedly dying before starting over , style, as she grapples with everything from the metaphysical ramifications of immortality, to the reckless selfishness of a mother who spent her inheritance on coats and a car, to whether it matters if co-star and fellow timeloop prisoner Alan (played by Charlie Barnett) cleans his apartment, since ""it'll reset when we die."" ,The series about death, rebirth, infinite second chances and the absurd meaninglessness of life was, unsurprisingly, drawn from Lyonne's past.,After being pushed into acting , (she played Woody Allen's daughter in ,, acted alongside Paul Reubens in , at six and made an appearance in 1999's ,)  Lyonne struggled with addiction and nearly died in 2005 from a drug-induced heart infection, followed by open-heart surgery in 2012. ,With all that in her back pocket,  Lyonne partnered with longtime friend and fellow comedian Amy Poehler to craft a series based on her life. The first attempt, a pilot made for NBC called ,, failed, prompting Lyonne to go even wilder on their next attempt — what would ultimately become , — as she assumed it would disappear unnoticed anyways.,Instead, we got the 2019 then-miniseries, a completely self-contained story with an arc and ending so perfect and impactful it had this reviewer opening his interview with the unprompted and unexplained quote: ""Thursday, what a concept!"",So Lyonne, like everyone else, knows the cultural impact ,'s first season had — and the challenge of following it up.,""It is very scary to do a sort of sophomore album, which is, I guess, how I looked at it,"" she said. ""But there's a real buoying sort of factor, to I guess the audience response of enjoying the deep dive that was Season 1."",""They want to be a part of that journey. And it felt like, 'Oh, maybe we're all kind of asking similar questions at the similar time because the world around us is so nuts.'"",Season 2 also acknowledges the Herculean act it's attempting by cribbing from the original at every turn.,Alongside the introduction of ,'s Annie Murphy (as well as Rosie O'Donnell in a cameo as the train announcer featured in much of the show) the gang's all back this time around.,Charlie Barnett returns, as well as co-stars Greta Lee and Rebecca Henderson, and we get constant callbacks to the original: the equally iconic ""sweet birthday baby!"" line gets thrown around by not one, but two characters; fan favourites Horse and Oatmeal (the latter Nadia's pet and possibly literal Schrödinger's cat, the former a possible homeless man, possible time god) earn mention. After travelling to Europe, Lyonne's character even swaps the Thursday line for a new one: ""Time zones, what a concept!"",Perhaps trying to sneak out from under the heel of a now-oppressive wave of multiversal, ""many-worlds-theory"" inspired stories that have grown so numerous since Season 1 they virtually constitute their own genre, ,Season 2 leans toward time travel instead.,Four years out from the original, this time Nadia is caught in a cycle that routinely sends her back to 1982. There, she stumbles through to solve the mystery of what happened to the inheritance her mother squandered — over $500,000 in South African krugerrands — before things get considerably more complex.,A host of requirements from Netflix keep me from explaining further, while the purposefully confusing nature of the show itself means the less you know going in, the better.,But suffice to say that Season 2 is an even deeper personal examination for Lyonne, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who herself was kicked out of an Orthodox Jewish academy for selling weed. ,But the personal examinations at the heart of this season do muddy the waters from the first. Where Season 1 was tight, streamlined and pithy, Season 2 can feel more aimless, experimental and grasping. Nadia alternatively struggles to sort out her mother's past, solve the mystery of time travel, accept surrogate mother Ruth's mortality, and come to terms with her own abysmal childhood — all while Alan has his own parallel adventure into the past. ,Even the concept of a sequel itself seems out of the blue for a first season that ended with few loose threads. While Nadia's issues with her mother were discussed in the original, the wholesale plot built around her for the new season feels more artificial ,a spiritual sequel connected more by theme than plot.,All that said, , has not fallen off. Even with a different feel than the original, Season 2 is still one of the best things on TV. Continuing from the first season, a writing room and rotating director's chair completely staffed by women pushes forward characters so well rounded and perfectly imperfect you just want to be their best friend.,The mystery is good too. The further we go into Nadia's (and, therefore, Lyonne's) past, the more you want to know. And even as we spend much of our time there confused — just like my interview — it draws you further in. ,I even asked Lyonne whether there might still be anything else to learn — a potential new story in a potential Season 3?,""We'll see,"" she said, raising her eyebrows. ""Only time travel will tell."""

Until we're dead.""  ,He also offers a straightforward summary of the new series.,""It's just us doing sketch comedy, at this stage in our life.

Canadian actress apologizes for darkening skin to play domestic worker in Hong Kong drama series,"A Hong Kong television series is being criticized for having a Canadian-born Hong Kong actress darken her skin to play a Filipina domestic worker.,In an episode that aired last week, Calgary-born Franchesca Wong wore brownface makeup to portray Louisa on ,, a supernatural drama on the Hong Kong broadcaster TVB.,According to the ,, Louisa works for a couple who suspect her of using voodoo, calling her ""spooky."" Wong also imitates a Filipino accent for the role.,The portrayal, which was both panned and praised by Hong Kong media, has inspired discussion of discrimination against migrant domestic workers. Critics have called Louisa a ""caricature,"" and noted the use of dark make-up and hiring a non-Filipina performer are disrespectful to Hong Kong's migrant worker population.,There are about 340,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, according to ,.

All I had to do was send the monster away and lock him up, we've been happier than ever,"" he texted to a former security guard.,""Amber and I have been absolutely perfect ... I have locked my monster child away in a cage deep within and it has f-----g worked,"" Depp said in a text to one of his doctors.,Depp said Heard used the word monster to describe when she thought he was using drugs or alcohol, though he said her perception was not always accurate.,In other texts to friends or associates, Depp referred to Heard as a ""filthy whore,"" and other names.,Writing to actor Paul Bettany in 2013, Depp made comments about drowning and burning Heard, and then having sex with her dead body.,Depp apologized to Heard in a text in 2014, saying he was a ""savage"" and ""went too far."",On Wednesday, Depp told a Virginia jury that Heard would ""strike out"" with a slap or shove.

The suit says the statement ""perpetuated an offensive stereotype about African-Americans."",The suit says in 2012, during the fifth season, Zolciak-Biermann made ""racially offensive and stereotypical"" comments about the new home of housewife Kandi Burruss, calling her neighbourhood a ""ghetto"" and perpetuating a racial stereotype in an offensive comment about whether Burruss needed a swimming pool.,That same year, the suit says, Zolciak-Biermann used the N-word to refer to Leakes and other housewives after a dispute with them, the suit alleges. It also alleges Zolciak-Biermann falsely implied that Leakes used drugs and called her home a ""roach nest."",The suit says after Leakes's complaints to the executives overseeing the show, they ""did not terminate their relationship with Zolciak-Biermann, nor take any other meaningful action to put an end to her racially offensive behaviour,"" and, if anything, rewarded her by giving her a spinoff show.,""From the day the series began filming, NeNe was the target of systemic racism from co-star Kim Zolciak-Biermann, which was tolerated by Bravo executive producer Andy Cohen and other executives,"" Leakes's lawyer David deRubertis said in a statement.,Joe Habachy, another of Leakes's attorneys, said via email ""not a day goes by that NeNe doesn't wake up with an onslaught of overwhelming emotions as a direct result of these unfortunate and avoidable occurrences."",The lawsuit alleges that her complaints of racism led in part to Leakes being forced off the show in 2020, before its 13th season.,The suit says Leakes's negotiations for the season came as the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum, with Leakes a vocal supporter.,Executives sought to sideline Leakes from talking about the cause, keeping her off early episodes in which the housewives would address BLM, the suit alleges.,""As the Black Lives Matter movement swept our nation, Mrs. Leakes — Bravo's historically most successful Black female talent — should have been embraced by NBC, Bravo and True,"" the suit says.

U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene denies calling for violence ahead of Jan. 6 riot,"Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene told a Georgia judge hearing an effort to block her from the ballot in her re-election bid that she had urged people to join a ""peaceful march"" on Jan. 6, 2021, that turned into a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol.,A group of voters has brought a novel legal challenge to Greene's re-election bid, arguing that the supporter of former president Donald Trump has violated a provision in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution known as the ""Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause."",The clause, passed after the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, prohibits politicians from running for Congress if they have engaged in ""insurrection or rebellion"" or ""given aid or comfort"" to the nation's enemies.,""I was asking people to come for a peaceful march, which everyone is entitled to do,"" Greene said. ""I was not asking them to actively engage in violence."",Andrew Celli, a lawyer for the voters, cross-examined Greene, who occasionally did not recall past statements she had made that had been captured on video or audio — including urging Trump to impose martial law and a Facebook video she posted in which she called Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi treasonous, and pointed out that treason was ""a crime punishable by death."",Greene at first denied making the statement about Pelosi, but then admitted to it under questioning by the Celli and the judge.,James Bopp, Greene's lawyer, argued that the statement was ""hyperbole"" and irrelevant to the case.,But Greene appeared perplexed when Celli asked if she advocates political violence against people with whom she disagrees.,""I don't think so,"" Greene replied. ""I don't know how to answer that."",Friday's hearing ended without the judge issuing a ruling.,During media interviews, Greene has downplayed and justified the assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters in their failed bid to block congressional certification of President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Greene this month said Democrats and journalists have pushed an ""over-dramatization"" of that day's events.,Celli played a clip of an interview Greene did Jan. 5, 2021, in which she said preventing the certification was ""our 1776 moment"" — an apparent reference to the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. When Celli asked if she was aware that some Trump supporters used that remark as a call to violence, Greene said that wasn't her intention and that she was talking about her plans to object to the certification of electoral votes.,""I was talking about the courage to object,"" she said.,Bopp argued during his opening remarks that removing her from the ballot would be both unfair to her and to voters in her conservative-leaning district.,""Fundamentally, First Amendment rights are at stake, not only the right to vote, as I've mentioned, or the right to run for office,"" Bopp said.,He called it a ""political show trial"" in his closing statement.,In Greene's defence, he then played a video she recorded after the Capitol had been breached in which she urged demonstrators to be peaceful.,But during Celli's cross-examination, she was unable to testify to any occasion between the 2020 election and Jan. 6 in which she urged those protesting the election outcome to be peaceful.,Greene is seeking re-election this year. The Republican primary is scheduled for May 24 and the general election on Nov. 8.,Absentee ballots will start to be mailed on April 25.,The voter challenge is being spearheaded by a group called Free Speech for People that advocates for campaign finance reform. Similar efforts from the group concerning Republican North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorn and three Republican representatives from Arizona were denied by the courts.,Greene is expected to appeal any ruling that goes against her, and has already brought parallel litigation in U.S. federal court seeking to halt the administrative proceeding.,The actions of Trump allies on or before Jan. 6 have come under scrutiny, with a congressional committee devoted to probe the Capitol riot expected to hold televised hearings sometime in May.,Late Thursday, Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, came under fire from his own party after an audio recording showed him saying that Trump should resign over the Capitol riot.,The comments, which McCarthy had denied hours before the recording emerged, could undermine his widely known ambition to become House speaker next year if Republicans take control of the chamber in November's midterm elections, which many are predicting.,Trump's actions are also being examined by that House committee, while his communications with Georgia officials after the 2020 election will be subject to a special grand jury in that state, with testimony expected in June. Trump's phone call in early January 2021 with Georgia officials including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger saw him beseech them to ""find"" votes that would allow him to surpass Biden.,In a statement Thursday, Trump incorrectly blamed Raffensperger and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, both Republicans, for allowing the challenge against Greene to proceed, saying she is ""going through hell in their attempt to unseat her."""

""I consider myself an actor — shyly,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in 1964. ""I love acting. It's a great use of body and mind... With all humility, you hope that you are doing something worthwhile."",More recently, he played the autocratic and eccentric leader of an advertising agency in ,, AMC's hit drama that debuted in 2007. The role earned him an Emmy nomination in 2008 as best guest actor in a drama series.,Morse was already well-established on Broadway, with two Tony nominations to his credit, when he became nationally famous at age 30 as the star of Abe Burrows and Frank Loesser's smash 1961 Broadway satire of corporate life, ""How to Succeed..."". The show won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Tony for best musical and ran for more than three years.,Morse's bright-eyed J. Pierrepont Finch was a master of corporate backstabbing — with a toothy grin — as he went from Manhattan window washer to titan at the World Wide Wicket company with the help of a little ""how-to"" paperback on office politics.,The musical's song titles suggest the button-down, pre-feminist business world: ,, a theme song for yes-men; ,, a song that winks at office dalliance; ,, a tribute to caffeine; and the hymn Finch sings to himself: ,. Finch toadies up to the aging boss, played by 1920s crooner Rudy Vallee, by joining in the old man's college fight song, ,.,""Imagine a collaboration between Horatio Alger and Machiavelli and you have Finch, the intrepid hero of this sortie into the canyons of commerce,"" The New York Times wrote.

I never got a chance to be in a play or picture where I played a father, or had a family, or where I could feel or show something. The wild child in me never had a chance to grow up."",He said he had successfully battled alcohol and drug abuse, but added, ""I don't think drinking got in the way of my work. I did my job.

Service Canada warns of long wait times due to 'unprecedented surge' in passport applications,"The federal government is warning that a massive surge in the number of Canadians applying for passports is causing long wait times at Service Canada locations across the country.,The demand for passports is said to be driven by the fact that many Canadians put off international travel for much of the pandemic.,With pandemic restrictions being eased in Canada and around the world, Canadians looking to travel have been turning up in massive numbers at passport offices.,The government says it is receiving more than 200,000 calls per day for passport requests at Service Canada.,That's about 40 times more calls than Service Canada typically received prior to the pandemic, when the agency handled about 5,000 passport requests daily.,""This unprecedented surge in demand has resulted in appointments filling up quickly,"" said a statement from Employment and Social Development Canada, which operates Service Canada locations.,""The Government of Canada recognizes that during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians had other things on their minds and planning to renew their passports was not a priority. However, this decrease in passport applications would by necessity result in a higher-than-normal surge at a later date."",Figures provided to CBC News show that requests for passports cratered during the first year of the pandemic.,From April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021, Service Canada issued 363,000 passports. ,A year later — between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022 — the agency issued 1,273,000 passports.,Service Canada also points to ongoing health and safety restrictions, which limit the number of staff allowed to work at a given location, as a factor in long wait times.,While long lines have become a fixture at Service Canada locations, the people who manage to submit their applications are still receiving their passports within typical processing times.,Ottawa says the turnaround time for people applying at one of Service Canada's 35 specialized passport sites is five business days. The government's ""service standard"" for those locations is 10 business days.,People applying at other Service Canada locations, or through the mail, are waiting an average of 25 business days to have their applications processed — slightly higher than that standard of 20 business days.,The government credits its introduction of a simplified passport renewal process with keeping processing times under control during the wave of new applications.,But some people applying for passports have told CBC News about days-long wait times. One family in Greater Vancouver reported making five unsuccessful attempts to submit an application at various locations around the city.,Under the updated guidelines, applicants are no longer required to have a guarantor or to provide original documents, such as proof of citizenship.,Any expired passport issued within the last 15 years can be renewed with fewer documents, which include two photos, two references, a completed application form and fees."

Former brother-in-law charged in killing of Toronto-born law prof in Florida,"A Florida dentist was arrested Thursday on charges that he hired hit men eight years ago to kill his sister's ex-husband, a prominent law professor, so she could move back to the Fort Lauderdale area from Tallahassee with her two children.,Charles Adelson, 45, was being held Thursday without bond at the Broward County jail on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation to commit murder after being arrested at his home by U.S. marshals. He is awaiting transfer to Tallahassee. His lawyer said Thursday he is innocent.,Adelson and other members of his family have long been cited by prosecutors and investigators as potential suspects in the July 18, 2014, killing of Florida State University law professor Dan Markel by two men at his Tallahassee home.,Markel, 41, had been married to Wendi Adelson, who had been unable to return to South Florida because Markel had joint custody of their young children after a highly contentious divorce.,Markel was born and raised in Toronto before heading to the U.S. for his post-secondary education, where he ultimately continued to reside.,Leon County State Attorney Jack Campbell said in a statement that Adelson was indicted by a grand jury after technicians were able to enhance the sound on an April 2016 video recording made secretly of him talking to a former girlfriend and employee, Katherine Magbanua. She was charged six months later with organizing the killing. ,""This recording includes statements by Charles Adelson, which can be heard clearly for the first time,"" Campbell said.,Magbanua is scheduled to be retried next month on a first-degree murder charge after a jury hung in 2019. Prosecutors say she hired Sigfredo Garcia, the father of her two children, to commit the murder and that he enlisted the help of his childhood friend, Luis Rivera.,Prosecutors said the two men drove from South Florida to Tallahassee to execute the plan, stalking Markel on the morning of the shooting as he dropped off his children at daycare and stopped at the gym. When Markel returned home, Garcia shot him as he sat in his car, talking on his cellphone.,Garcia is serving a life sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder in 2019. Rivera is serving a 19-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testifying against Garcia and Magbanua.,David Markus, Adelson's lawyer, said his client is innocent and tied the arrest to Magbanua's retrial.,""Prosecutors have no new information that led to this arrest. The timing sure does stink, doesn't it? On the eve of a long-awaited trial of [Magbanua], this move has the smell of desperation,"" Markus said in an emailed statement.,Campbell did not specify which statements led to Adelson's arrest, but the 41-minute recording, taken while Adelson was under police surveillance, shows him sitting with Magbanua at a noisy Mexican restaurant. The hidden camera recording them appears to be sitting on a bench across the aisle.,Adelson first told Magbanua that if the police knew anything, ""we would have already gone to the airport."" He then told her that the police simply putting someone in a car or with someone else isn't enough for a conviction — they and prosecutors need proof the person was involved in the crime.,He then told her that someone had approached his mother and demanded money. He told Magbanua that the man knew details about the killing and mentioned her.,But as he contemplated whether the extortionist might be an undercover police officer trying to rattle his mother, he denied any involvement in the shooting — something he did repeatedly throughout the rest of the conversation.,""If it's a cop, I'm happy because I've got nothing to hide,"" Adelson told Magbanua.,He then told Magbanua she needs to contact the extortionist and tell him that a one-time payment will be made, but the Adelsons will contact the police if he or anyone else demands further money.,""The whole time you are talking, you just say, 'I don't know what's going on,""' Adelson told her. ""If it's the police, they can't take the money. They won't even come meet you."",He tells Magbanua that his mother can't meet with the extortionist because that will just lead to further demands. ""If my parents were guilty, they may think they have a really big fish on the line that's gonna pay them monthly,"" he said.,He tries to calm Magbanua's worries by telling her: ""You giving somebody some money is not an admission of any kind of guilt."""

"EU deal targets Big Tech over hate speech, disinformation","The European Union reached a landmark deal early Saturday to take aim at hate speech, disinformation and other harmful online content.,The law will force big tech companies to police themselves harder, make it easier for users to flag problems and empower regulators to punish noncompliance with billions in fines.,EU officials finally clinched the agreement in principle in the early hours of Saturday. The Digital Services Act will overhaul the digital rulebook for 27 countries and cement Europe's reputation as the global leader in reining in the power of social media companies and other digital platforms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.,""With the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are 'too big to care' is coming to an end,"" said EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton.,EU Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager added that ""with today's agreement we ensure that platforms are held accountable for the risks their services can pose to society and citizens."",The act is the EU's third significant law targeting the tech industry, a notable contrast with the U.S., where lobbyists representing Silicon Valley's interests have largely succeeded in keeping federal lawmakers at bay.,While the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed major antitrust actions against Google and Facebook, Congress remains politically divided on efforts to address competition, online privacy, disinformation and more.,The EU's new rules, which are designed to protect internet users and their ""fundamental rights online,"" should make tech companies more accountable for content created by users and amplified by their platforms' algorithms.,Breton said they will have plenty of stick to back up their laws.,""It entrusts the Commission with supervising very large platforms, including the possibility to impose effective and dissuasive sanctions of up to 6 per cent of global turnover or even a ban on operating in the EU single market in case of repeated serious breaches,"" he said.,The tentative agreement was reached between the EU parliament and member states. It still needs to be officially rubber-stamped by those institutions but should pose no political problem.,""The DSA is nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation. It's the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets,"" said Ben Scott, a former tech policy advisor to Hillary Clinton who's now executive director of advocacy group Reset.,Negotiators had been hoping to hammer out a deal before French elections Sunday. A new French government could stake out different positions on digital content.,The need to regulate Big Tech more effectively came into sharper focus after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Russia was found to have used social media platforms to try to influence the country's vote. Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter promised to crack down on disinformation, but the problems have only worsened. During the pandemic, health misinformation blossomed and again the companies were slow to act, cracking down after years of allowing anti-vaccine falsehoods to thrive on their platforms.,Under the EU law, governments would be able to request companies take down a wide range of content that would be deemed illegal, including material that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial scams. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter would have to give users tools to flag such content in an ""easy and effective way"" so that it can be swiftly removed. Online marketplaces like Amazon would have to do the same for dodgy products, such as counterfeit sneakers or unsafe toys.,These systems will be standardized so that they will work the same way on any online platform.,The tech giants have been lobbying furiously in Brussels to water down the EU rules.,Twitter said Saturday it would review the rules ""in detail"" and that it supports ""smart, forward thinking regulation that balances the need to tackle online harm with protecting the Open Internet."",Google said in a statement on Friday that it looks forward to ""working with policymakers to get the remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for everyone."" Amazon referred to a blog post from last year that said it welcomed measures that enhance trust in online services. Facebook didn't respond to requests for comment.,The Digital Services Act would ban ads targeted at minors, as well as ads targeted at users based on their gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation. It would also ban deceptive techniques companies use to nudge people into doing things they didn't intend to, such as signing up for services that are easy to opt into, but hard to decline.,To show they're making progress on limiting these practices, tech companies would have to carry out annual risk assessments of their platforms.,Up until now, regulators have had no access to the inner workings at Google, Facebook and other popular services. But under the new law, the companies will have to be more transparent and provide information to regulators and independent researchers on content-moderation efforts. This could mean, for example, making YouTube turn over data on whether its recommendation algorithm has been directing users to more Russian propaganda than normal.,To enforce the new rules, the European Commission is expected to hire more than 200 new staffers. To pay for it, tech companies will be charged a ""supervisory fee,"" which could be up to 0.1% of their annual global net income, depending on the negotiations.,The EU reached a separate agreement last month on its so-called Digital Markets Act, a law aimed at reining in the market power of tech giants and making them treat smaller rivals fairly.,And in 2018, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation set the global standard for data privacy protection, though it has faced criticism for not being effective at changing the behaviour of tech companies. Much of the problem centres on the fact that a company's lead privacy regulator is in the country where its European head office is located, which for most tech companies is Ireland.,Irish regulators have opened dozens of data-privacy investigations, but have only issued judgments for a handful. Critics say the problem is understaffing, but the Irish regulator says the cases are complex and time-consuming.,EU officials say they have learned from that experience and will make the bloc's executive Commission the enforcer for the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act."
U.S. ambassador says he's confident Canada will strengthen its defences in the Arctic,"America's top diplomat in Ottawa says he's been assured Canada will follow through this year on crucial investments to modernize its Arctic defence, even though this month's budget didn't include money for that work.,Ambassador David Cohen told CBC's ,in an interview airing this weekend that Canada needs to make Arctic air and maritime defence a national priority. He said he's made that point in ""candid conversations"" with senior cabinet ministers since he took up the post in December.,""So I think there's an acknowledgement that this budget does not include funding for NORAD, for modernizing and improving the northern defence for Canada and for the United States, but that it will be forthcoming during the course of this fiscal year,"" he said.,The United States has complained for a very long time that Canada hasn't been living up to its NATO commitment to boost its military spending to two per cent of national GDP. Barack Obama raised it during his speech to Parliament in 2016. Donald Trump took up the refrain even more assertively during his time in the White House.,Cohen isn't a career diplomat or politician. He is, on the other hand, a successful business executive and lobbyist, a man described by the Washington Post a decade ago as a policy wonk with extensive Beltway contacts and an ability to distil complex issues.,Those are also useful skills in Ottawa — where politicians pay far more attention to what goes on south of the border than their American counterparts display when it comes to Canadian politics.,But North American security is one subject the U.S. cared about deeply long before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and long before China began asserting itself as a polar power with a claim to the Arctic's resources.,Cohen acknowledged during the interview at the U.S. embassy that the budget did include another $8 billion in defence spending. But he said Russia and China's increasing activity in the North must be countered by a more robust Canadian presence at the top of the world.,""The United States has been told, I have been told and other officials in the White House and in Washington have been told that when we discussed the $8 billion increase in defence spending, (we've) been told that, remember, that doesn't even include anything for NORAD modernization,"" he said. ""That will be an add-on as we continue to review what NORAD requires."",Liberal MP John McKay estimates the cost of modernizing NORAD could run to billions of dollars.,McKay, chair of the Commons defence committee, has been a vocal critic of Canada's failure to respond to Russia's growing military presence in the Arctic. He told CBC News that Russia has built or refurbished 11 bases across the region, while Canada has only one base in Alert.,""There is an absolute necessity for the government of Canada to be alive to the military needs of the Arctic,"" he said when asked for his reaction to Cohen's comments.,""We have underestimated, continuously underestimated, Putin's willingness to engage in a military fashion over the last number of years. And we cannot afford that risk."",But the prime minister has been unclear about Canada's position. Justin Trudeau told reporters this week that security is only one part of his government's focus in the North. Addressing climate change and promoting economic opportunities for the Inuit are equally important, he said.,""We are in a time of of reflection around how we ensure Canada's continued sovereignty in the Arctic, and in times past or governments past that would have happened through a military lens,"" he said Thursday after announcing a new engagement policy with Inuit.,""Can we put more bases in the North? Can we show that we're ready to defend and control our Arctic? What this policy, and quite frankly, the relationship that we've built over the past number of years in the Crown-Inuit partnership [shows] is [that] sovereignty in the North passes through the people who live there and who have lived there for millennia."",A spokesperson for Defence Minister Anita Anand said Arctic defence is a key government priority.,Daniel Minden wrote in an email that the budget did include $252 million over five years in initial military funding, ""with new investments in situational awareness, modernized command and control systems, research and development, and defence capabilities to deter and defeat aerospace threats to this continent."",Cooperation on shared defence priorities isn't the only file to land on Cohen's desk since he arrived in Ottawa just before anti-vaccine mandate protests locked down the nation's capital for weeks.,Trade and climate change are two other topics where there's potential for conflict.,The Trudeau government lobbied hard last year for Canada's exemption from a proposal in President Joe Biden's now-defeated Build Back Better bill that would have given a $12,500 tax credit to buyers of electric vehicles — provided the vehicles were made in the U.S. by unionized workers.,Cohen said the proposed tax credit to boost U.S. electric vehicle sales isn't dead, but a compromise to ensure Canadian auto parts suppliers aren't shut out is in the works.,""I'll remind you that the prime minister actually threw out a possible solution to that, which is that if the U.S. legislation was rewritten to be North American, that Canada would entertain increasing its credits for electric vehicles, which tend to be in the form of consumer rebates,"" he said.,Cohen also sought to alleviate concerns about U.S. protectionism, and any lingering concerns about the shutdown of the Ambassador Bridge by protesters in February, by pointing to a speech this week by the director of Biden's National Economic Council, Brian Deese.,""He said a lot of things in that speech but the headline for this question is that it is not possible for the United States or any country to domestically produce 100 per cent of the components of our supply chain,"" Cohen said. ""We need to have strong partnerships and relationships with allies in order to secure a reliable and resilient supply chain.,""So there's now a direct answer from the White House to your question [about] whether the desire and commitment to maintain and grow the interconnectedness of the supply chain between Canada and the United States remains."""
Quebec City drunk driver sentenced to 16 years for killing 4 members of family,"The Quebec City driver who killed two children, their mother and their grandfather last fall when his car crashed into theirs has been sentenced to 16 years in prison.,Éric Légaré, 44, was under the influence of alcohol and speeding when the vehicle he was driving crashed into three other vehicles waiting for a left-turn signal at an intersection in Beauport, Que., on Sept. 2, 2021. ,Emma Lemieux, 10, her half-brother Jackson Fortin, 14, their mother, Shellie Fletcher-Lemieux, 44, and grandfather, James Fletcher, 68, , sustained in the collision.,""It's not a question here of determining the cost of a life,"" said Quebec court Judge Jean-Louis Lemay at Légaré's sentencing hearing in a Quebec City courtroom Friday.  ,Lemay said his job was to determine a just sentence based on objective facts, the law and legal precedent. He said it is important to match the severity of a sentence to society's evolving view of the act of driving under the influence. ,""It falls on courts to use tools provided by Parliament to attack this societal evil,"" Lemay said in his ruling. ,The Crown had sought an 18- to 20-year prison term for Légaré and a lifelong driving ban, but prosecutor Pierre-Alexandre Bernard said he was ""not disappointed at all"" with the 16-year sentence — the longest ever meted out in Quebec for a crime committed under similar circumstances.,Another Quebecer, Roger Walsh, did , while driving under the influence in 2008, however Walsh had had 19 previous drunk-driving convictions and a long list of other criminal offences.,By comparison, Légaré had a single prior conviction for driving under the influence, in 2017. ,Bernard said he hoped Légaré's sentence would send ""a clear message to anyone who tries, and who commits those kinds of offences, that those offences are not tolerated in our society."",Légaré's lawyer, Vincent Montminy, said he found the sentence reasonable, even though it's significantly higher than the 10 years he had sought.,""I consider it's a judgment that's adequate,"" he said.,Montminy, who spoke to Légaré after the ruling, said his client is devastated but will not seek leave to appeal the sentence.,""He didn't fall off his chair. He knew that he was in that ballpark, for sure."",During his trial testimony, Légaré had burst into tears and expressed his remorse to the victims' families, saying he had regular nightmares about what he had done.,He admitted to drinking and smoking weed more frequently in the months before the crash because of difficulties in his personal life.,The courtroom was packed for the sentencing hearing, with relatives of the victims and of the convicted man waiting attentively.,Jean-Dominic Lemieux, Emma's father and Shellie's husband of nine years, was notably absent.,Jackson's father, Daniel Fortin, said he squeezed the hands of his two friends very hard when the judge announced his decision. He said he's left relieved and somewhat satisfied with the strong message the harsh sentence sends.,""I think it's a good step,"" he said.,While he said no sentence could alleviate the pain of losing his child, he felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders with the end of the legal proceedings.,""It's a little bandage on the wound,"" he said. ""We'll be able to start grieving."""

7 youths charged with second-degree murder in death of Edmonton high school student,"Seven teenagers — six boys and a girl — have been charged with second-degree murder in the stabbing death of a 16-year-old Edmonton high school student.,Karanveer Sahota, a Grade 10 student at McNally High School, was waiting for a bus on the afternoon of April 8 when he was assaulted.,Sahota and the seven accused were known to each other, Edmonton police said Friday.,Police said the assault is believed to be an escalation of violence between two rival groups but that there is no evidence of gang involvement.,Sahota died in hospital April 15. An autopsy confirmed the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.,""Any loss of life is tragic,"" Supt. Shane Perka of the Edmonton Police Service's criminal investigations division said at a news conference Friday.,""The loss of a youth, in such a manner, is nearly unheard of in our city. To say it has been difficult is an understatement."",Perka said Sahota suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack.,The teens charged include six boys — two 14-year-olds, two 15-year-olds and two 16-year-olds — and a 17-year-old girl. The girl is also charged with attempted obstruction.,The charges were all upgraded to second-degree murder after the victim died and an autopsy was completed, Perka said.,Police said six youths were originally charged with attempted murder in relation to the assault on Sahota. They were arrested over the course of several days the week after the incident. A warrant was issued for the seventh youth.,The investigation was incredibly complex, Perka said, but the influx of information provided by the public helped police identify all seven suspects.,""There is nothing to indicate that this involved gang activity whatsoever,"" Perka said. ""These were just high school youths that had a bit of a history of disagreeing with each other."",Police do not anticipate further charges, Perka said.,Police could not say definitively which of the charged teenagers will be remanded into custody, but each will go through the bail-hearing process. The five teenagers who appeared before a judge Friday were granted bail. They will next appear in court May 13.,A publication ban imposed Friday afternoon protected the names of the seven accused and of the victim, whose name had already been made public with permission from his family.,CBC News successfully challenged the publication ban, resulting in the judge allowing Sahota's name to be published.,The seven accused cannot be named to protect their identities as minors. "
"Tour boat carrying 26 people missing, reported sinking off Japan's northern coast","A tour boat with 26 people aboard was missing in rough and cold waters off northern Japan on Saturday after issuing a distress call and reporting to be sinking, the coast guard said.,No survivors have been found after more than 10 hours of an intense search involving six patrol boats, five aircraft and divers. The coast guard said it will continue with the search through the night.,The 17-tonne Kazu 1 made an emergency call, saying the ship's bow had flooded and was beginning to sink and tilt while it was travelling off the western coast of Shiretoko Peninsula, on the northern island of Hokkaido, the coast guard said.,The tour boat has since lost contact, according to the coast guard. It said the boat was carrying 24 passengers, including two children, and two crew members.,Average April sea temperatures in Shiretoko National Park are just above freezing.,An official with the vessel's operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise, said he could not comment as he had to respond to calls from worried families of the passengers.,Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who was attending a two-day water summit in Kumamoto in southern Japan, was cancelling his program for Sunday and was set to return to Tokyo to deal with the missing boat, the NHK public broadcaster reported.,High waves and strong winds were observed in the area around noon, according to a local fisheries co-operative. Japanese media reports said fishing boats had returned to port before noon because of the bad weather.,NHK said there was a warning for high waves of up to three metres high.,Yoshihiko Yamada, a Tokai University marine science professor, said the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged, flooded and probably sank. A tour boat of that size does not usually carry a lifeboat, and passengers possibly could not jump out of a rapidly sinking vessel with its windows probably closed to shield them from strong winds.,In an interview with TBS television, Yamada said there is also a slight possibility that the boat might have been hit by a whale.,The cold temperatures and strong winds could cause hypothermia and put the passengers in severe conditions for survival, according to Jun Abe, vice-chair of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research. ""It's a very severe condition, especially when they are wet,"" he told TBS.,According to the operator's website, the tour takes about three hours and offers a scenic view of the western coast of the peninsula.,The national park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is famous as the southernmost region to see drifting sea ice."
"Police pursuits claimed 77 lives over a decade in Canada, study finds","Seventy-seven people died in police pursuits over a 10-year period in Canada, according to a study by an independent public watchdog.,The study, released through federal access-to-information law, analyzed 871 pursuits involving the RCMP and other police forces nationwide. It found that officers were injured in seven per cent of the pursuits the researchers examined.,Drivers and passengers in fleeing vehicles were injured in 23 per cent of the pursuits, while innocent parties were injured in 10 per cent of cases.,""The decision to initiate, join, or disengage a pursuit is a calculated and time-sensitive one that front-line police officers make …"" the study says. ""An officer's discretion could potentially have consequences to their own and public safety."" ,Dated September 2021, the previously unpublished study by the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP covers the 10-year period ending in 2019 and is based on media reports.,Pursuits that failed to make the news are not included.,The ""RCMP recognizes that police pursuits can pose a danger to public and police safety,"" said Robin Percival, spokesperson for RCMP headquarters in Ottawa.,In 2021, the RCMP revised its Emergency Vehicle Operations policy to stipulate that Mounties can initiate or continue a vehicle pursuit only if they reasonably believe the suspect has committed (or is about to commit) a serious act of violence — and only if failing to immediately arrest the suspect would pose a greater risk to public safety than a pursuit.,The old policy said an RCMP officer could initiate a pursuit when a suspect driver refused to stop for a peace officer and attempted to evade apprehension. The policy did not require officers to pursue drivers simply for attempting to evade arrest and said pursuits should be reconsidered in cases where the driver could be identified and apprehended at another time.,The new policy also requires all frontline RCMP members to successfully complete an updated online course on emergency vehicle operations. In the past, only supervisors were required to take the course., , Each module of the course contains scenario-based learning to provide RCMP officers with real-life examples they may encounter during the course of their duties, Percival said.,The study says that aerial pursuits — helicopter, drone, or fixed-wing aircraft — are a safer and more effective option to ground pursuits. They're also costlier.,""One of the primary advantages of the use of aerial support is that it allows police to safely and effectively monitor suspects' movements from a distance as they assist tactical units on the ground, thereby reducing direct interaction between fleeing suspects, pursuing units and the public,"" says the study.,Of the 114 aerial pursuits analyzed in the study, only three ended without someone being taken into custody. Police engaged in aerial pursuits typically use infrared cameras to track the heat signatures of suspects who flee their vehicles and hide.,Alberta accounted for 38 per cent of those 114 aerial pursuits, while 23 per cent occurred in B.C. and 22 per cent took place in Ontario.,The RCMP was involved in 57 per cent of the aerial pursuits and 52 per cent of spike-belt incidents examined in the study. In 2019, the force employed 26 per cent of the 67,618 police officers in Canada, says Statistics Canada.,Percival said that while airborne pursuits are effective, ""aircraft represent a significant cost"" and further investments ""must be balanced against other priorities."",Among non-RCMP agencies, the Winnipeg Police Service flight operations unit was involved in 101 vehicle ""follows/pursuits"" in 2020, according to its annual report. In 2020, the Saskatoon Police Service air support unit was instrumental in the arrest of 251 suspects, up 22 per cent from 2019.,The study also found that in almost one-quarter of police pursuits, suspect drivers collided with (or attempted to collide with) police vehicles.,Spike belts were used in 25 per cent of cases — which often involved stolen vehicles — and succeeded in close to two-thirds of those cases. Stolen pickup trucks were the most common vehicle involved in pursuits, and the fleeing suspects were overwhelming male.,Ontario and Alberta each accounted for 24 per cent of the total pursuits involving spike belts. Just over half of all cases in which spike belts were deployed involved the RCMP.,Often, pursuing officers used additional force to apprehend the suspect, such as police dogs, batons, Tasers and firearms.,""Although the use of spike belts has been encouraged as a means of apprehending a suspect, representative data did not demonstrate a significant risk reduction to public and officer safety,"" the study found.,Ontario's Police Services Act has a regulation on police pursuits that requires officers to weigh the severity of the crime — the need to catch the suspect — against the risk to public safety.,Ontario Provincial Police spokesperson Bill Dickson said that initiating a pursuit is an ""option of last resort"" and is considered ""only when other alternatives are unavailable or unsatisfactory."",During a pursuit, he said, officers ""must continuously assess whether the risk to public safety in the pursuit outweighs the risk to public safety if the suspect is not immediately apprehended."",All pursuits are monitored by a supervisor, Dickson added. And while the officer involved in the pursuit can discontinue it at any time, the supervising sergeant ""has the final decision-making responsibility,"" he said.,OPP Const. Timothy Groves pleaded guilty to careless driving and was fined $2,500 on Dec. 22, 2020 in Provincial Offences Court in London, Ont., in connection with a police pursuit. The more serious criminal charges — two counts of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, and one count of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle — were withdrawn.,Porsche Clark, then 28, and her daughter Skyla — aged 9 at the time — were seriously injured on July 28, 2019, when the taxi they were in was struck by Groves' police vehicle as he pursued two bank robbery suspects.,Kevin Egan, a personal injury lawyer representing the Clarks, said he believes the OPP's pursuit policy is adequate — as long as officers follow it. ,""It requires a constant evaluation of the risk-reward,"" he said.,Complicating matters, a police pursuit can overlap multiple police jurisdictions, requiring officers and supervisors from different police services to continuously gauge the risk of continued pursuit.,In the Clarks' case, the high-speed pursuit started with the Sarnia Police Service, was taken up by the provincial police and eventually entered the jurisdiction of the London Police Service.,The statement of claim filed by the Clarks in Ontario's Superior Court of Justice in July 2021 describes a pursuit which reached speeds of at least 180 kmh. The statement said that spike belts were deployed twice during the pursuit — without success — that the suspect vehicle took a run at police and its driver ignored a police officer pointing a gun at him, and that an OPP vehicle collided with another car containing a family, resulting in injuries.,Egan said no defence has been filed in the civil law suit and he expects the matter to be settled out of court. ,The Clarks' statement of claim seeks $13 million in damages.,The claim says Porsche Clark suffered multiple serious injuries, including a broken neck, a collapsed lung, a spinal fracture and a brain injury. The claim says her daughter experienced ""internal decapitation, ligamentous separation of her spinal column from her skull base."",Egan said he's still amazed that neither of his clients was killed. He said the fact that Skyla ""can now walk on her own and breathe without a tube and can eat is absolutely a miracle."",The police pursuit study concludes there is a lack of ""publicly accessible, standardized and comprehensive data collection and reporting"" on police pursuits in Canada and calls for more comprehensive studies.,Neil Boyd, a criminology professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., said an officer's decision to pursue a suspect or call it off can be as consequential as the decision to use a gun.,""It doesn't have quite the lethality of a shooting … but it's a very similar kind of decision,"" he said.,Boyd said that while the study ""raises interesting questions,"" he would like to know more about the individual circumstances of the pursuits cited the study and the appropriateness of police actions.,""It depends what the bad guy did and what the threat was to the community,"" he said. ""We need more detail."""
Some Canadians fear mental health groups are reinforcing stigma by erasing 'schizophrenia' from their names,"Lesley McCuaig remembers how angry she was when she was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2016.,""I think it was coming from a bit of fear, fear of the unknown,"" she told,.,McCuaig previously sought help for, prior to her diagnosis. But when her schizophrenia diagnosis came in, she thought ""all of my goals and dreams were over."",""I think that comes from some of the stigma that's out there, that schizophrenia can be crippling — which it can be, but you can also lead a very fulfilling life with the diagnosis of schizophrenia,"" she said.,McCuaig is , living with schizophrenia, based on federal data from 2016-2017. But despite how common the illness is, some organizations say they find it difficult to raise funds and support for schizophrenia research due to the stigma surrounding the illness.,It's gotten to the point where some organizations are removing ""schizophrenia"" from their names.,""We … heard from people that our name was often a barrier, because there was such a stigma related to the word 'schizophrenia' that people would feel very uncomfortable calling us,"" Mary Alberti, CEO of the Institute for Advancements in Mental Health, told ,. ,For decades, the Toronto-based organization served Canadians with complex mental health needs as the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario. ,But after receiving complaints from people living with schizophrenia that the name presented a barrier to getting treatment, the society changed its name in 2020, its CEO said.,""We would have people saying, 'Please don't mail us anything that has a return address of Schizophrenia Society on it, because we feel very uncomfortable with that,'"" Alberti said.,Karen Slaunwhite knows how much of an issue this is.,She's the executive director of the Schizophrenia Society of Nova Scotia, which supports individuals living with schizophrenia through wellness and scholarship programs.,But the organization is in the process of changing its name to reflect other types of mental illness.,Slaunwhite said it can be a challenge to find corporate sponsors, because some think schizophrenia is not as ""attractive"" a cause when compared to other mental illnesses.,""Anxiety and depression are considered more mainstream, so [sponsors] can more readily get behind that,"" she said. ""They probably know a number of people who live with anxiety, depression or both — but may not know anybody who lives with schizophrenia."",McCuaig said it makes her feel ""a bit sad"" to know some people are hesitant to fund groups that support research or treatment for those living with schizophrenia — but she doesn't think name changes are the answer. ,""The fact that corporate Canada or corporate America sees the name 'schizophrenia' and shies away from donating is telling us something: that we need to make campaigns that make [sponsors] more aware,"" she said.,Faydra Aldridge has seen the effect of stigma on those living with schizophrenia. Her sister, Carissa Lynn, died as a result of the illness.,""When people say that they have heart disease or Parkinson's, we as a society lean in. We say, 'What can we do to help you?'"" said Aldridge, CEO of the British Columbia Schizophrenia Society. ""When somebody has schizophrenia, people tend to back off."",Aldridge agrees with her counterparts in Ontario and Nova Scotia that there are misconceptions around schizophrenia. But she doesn't think stripping the name of the illness from her organization should be the way forward.,""It's really important to have clinicians and researchers using the exact same terminology so that they can be working together to increase new treatments [and] improving the quality of life for people living with psychosis,"" she said.,Beyond that, erasing ""schizophrenia"" from organizations' names reinforces the mistaken belief that there should be stigma attached to the word — or to the illness itself, she said. ,""By changing the name … we are adding to the stigma, because we are giving the impression that people should be hiding."",The head of the Institute for Advancements in Mental Health, however, said the name change has been the right decision in her case — and one she said was ""driven by"" those living with schizophrenia and their families.  ,""People [are] calling us now who know that there is something wrong, but they don't know what is wrong,"" Alberti said. ""They've come to us and we're able to help and support them."",But McCuaig feels differently.,""At the beginning of my illness … I hid and tucked away what I was experiencing and why I was so sick, and people found it very hard to understand what was happening with me,"" she said.,""But as I became more open and honest, I found that my support network actually grew, because people were more aware and more sensitive to the fact that I had schizophrenia."",It's by keeping the term ""schizophrenia"" connected to supportive organizations that will help people living with the condition begin to feel recognized and included, she said. ,""This mental illness deserves time and space, and I think by keeping the name, it gives it that time and space,"" she said.,Six years after her diagnosis, McCuaig is now working on a master's degree in counselling psychology at Yorkville University. And she's speaking publicly about living with schizophrenia.,""I think it's given me a lot of confidence,"" she said. ""I get a lot of positive remarks, and I think it's very important for people who are flourishing with schizophrenia to speak out and let people know that there is help available, that there is hope."""

'Somebody's got to do it': Raptors try to make history with 3-0 comeback vs. 76ers,"Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse is unruffled by the fact no team in NBA history has come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series.,""I think it's a heckuva challenge, and somebody's got to do it,"" Nurse said. ""And if it gets to 3-1, it's not 3-0 anymore. And 3-1's been done."",The Raptors could be four wins away from history, but they're also one loss away from elimination, could be missing injured rookie Scottie Barnes again Saturday, and have yet to see a really good game from all-stars Fred VanVleet and Pascal Siakam.,The series was close to turning in Wednesday's overtime loss, but Joel Embiid's buzzer-beating three-pointer sent the Sixers into Saturday's Game 4 with a 3-0 lead.,""We feel like we were super close last game, that was an opportunity to get one, but at the same time, it's one game at a time. That's the only approach we can have,"" Siakam said.,""History is cool but this one [Saturday] is the most important game of our lives, basically, and I think that's all that matters. We've got to get that one and then we've got to think about the rest after."",NBA teams have come back from 3-1 deficits 13 times. The Denver Nuggets did it twice in the 2020 playoffs, beating Utah in the first round and the L.A. Clippers in the conference semis, the third 3-1 blown lead for head coach Doc Rivers, who of course, now coaches the Sixers.,Philly has also lost two series after leading 3-1.,The Raptors have been swept in three playoff series, twice by Cleveland (2017 and '18 conference semifinals), and by the Washington Wizards in the opening round in 2015.,The return of Barnes on Saturday would go a long way in the Raptors avoiding a sweep. He's still listed as doubtful with a sprained left ankle, but Nurse said he participated in parts of practice on Friday, and he's not ruling out the possibility he may play.,Barnes, a finalist for NBA rookie of the year, was excellent in his playoff debut in Game 1, racking up 15 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists before he was injured with about nine minutes to play when Embiid, a seven-foot mountain of a man, stepped on his foot.,Gary Trent Jr., who had 24 points in Game 3, will be healthier on Saturday. He was under the weather for a week, dropping eight pounds due to a non-COVID-19 illness.,Siakam received plenty of heat on social media after he went scoreless in the second half and overtime of Wednesday's 104-101 loss, and took just five shots in the stretch.,""I watched the game, I didn't realize I took five shots the whole second half . . . so for me, that was the first thing, maybe be more aggressive,"" he said. ""We came out in the second half a little slow, they got a little rhythm and Embiid got going there. But yeah, just be more aggressive and just taking what the defence [gives] basically."",With all the Raptors have faced the past couple of years, Siakam said he welcomes the challenge Saturday poses. The Raptors played all of last season out of Tampa, Fla., due to border restrictions caused by the pandemic, then a COVID-19 outbreak last March saw them go 1-14 during that month and tumble down the standings to finish 12th and miss the playoffs for the first time in eight seasons.,This season saw them play numerous games in an empty Scotiabank Arena due to pandemic restrictions in Ontario.,""The journey, the season that we had, all the ups and downs we had as a team and individually, it's a great opportunity for us to look ourselves in the mirror and just go out there, give everything that we've got and worry about that one game,"" Siakam said.,The Raptors coughed up a 17-point lead on Wednesday, the loss sealed on Embiid's clutch three-point shot. But the Raptors had several chances to win the game before it got to that point, and that's a reason for optimism, Nurse said.,""You've got to make a free throw or you've got to make an open shot. That's it,"" he said. ""I'd be way more worried if we were down there dribbling in circles and the shot clock was expiring, or we were hoisting up turn-around, running three-pointers, [if] things like that were going on on the other end."",Nurse said he hasn't addressed the team about the potential for elimination.,""I think that they're probably fully aware that this is win or be done, put the balls away for the year,"" he said. ""Listen, I thought we did a really good job of making some adjustments against them the other night. I thought we executed on a lot. . . we got 'em to 90 points with a minute fifty to go in the game, and a super high-powered offensive team with scorers all over the place. So we certainly are doing some things right.,""We had a chance to win. We had several chances to win."",In 2015's sweep by Washington, the dispirited Raptors were clobbered 125-94 in Game 4. Does Nurse fear any mental stepback on Saturday?,""No, none at all,"" he said. ""They're going to come and play."",Game 5, if needed, would be Monday in Philadelphia."
"At Venice Biennale, Canadian art star Stan Douglas explores the meaning of protest in the social media era","At first glance, the four huge photographs of protests by Vancouver artist Stan Douglas displayed in the small, angular Canadian pavilion of the Venice Art Biennale look like reportage.,There's an aerial view of the Tottenham riots in the U.K., with smoke, scattered protesters and police flanks; a scene of Occupy Wall Street in New York with non-violent resisters being arrested; clusters of young people gathered on the main avenue in Tunis, Tunisia, peacefully discussing politics and an alternate future at the onset of the Arab Spring; and the Vancouver riots after the Canucks were defeated in the Stanley Cup finals, with a crowd of hockey fans cheering an overturned car that has been set ablaze.,Yet on closer examination, the viewer notices every single person, object and structure captured by the camera is in perfect focus and fully rendered.,These images are not photojournalism at all, but elaborately produced reimaginings of real events, all of which took place in 2011.,""It's the idea of poetic condensation,"" said Douglas, one of Canada's most internationally acclaimed artists, ""of having as much information in one place to allow the viewer to see it and parse it as they need to. It has a sense of unreality. ,""But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'm saying this construction is less a snapshot of the moment, but more a schematic or diagram of a riot."",He calls this form ""hybrid documentaries."",The two-part show — the photographic series , and the video installation ,, in another part of Venice — marks Douglas's fifth appearance at the Venice Art Biennale, perhaps the most prestigious art exhibition in the world.,But it's his first show as Canada's officially selected artist, and the first time Canada has chosen a Black artist.,In ,, Douglas links the protests of 2011 to the widespread upheaval of the 1848 ""Springtime of Nations,"" when bourgeois uprisings against the aristocracy erupted across Europe.,Douglas is interested in the similarities between the two years — the 1848 protests spread with the help of print technology, whereas the 2011 blew up thanks to social media.,""Many of the events you see depicted were made larger by people saying, 'This is going on. Come down.' The example of the Arab Spring is what inspired Occupy Wall Street,"" he said.,But there are key differences: 1848 ultimately led to the formation of nation-states, whereas the social inequality that fomented the 2011 protests — a ripple effect of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 — remains depressingly unresolved, he says.,Other events since then, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Lives Matter, have shone more light on the underlying social inequality.,The second part of Douglas's show, ,, is set just before 2011, as the use of the digital transmission system to transmit audio over traditional phone lines began to decline, and is more hopeful.,Two giant screens hang in a disused 16th-century salt warehouse with U.K. grime musicians projected on one and ,artists (who fuse hip hop, electronica and Egyptian folk music) on the other. ,The two groups of rappers seem to perform an endless call-and-response, but it's fictitious, as they were each recorded separately, without listening to the other.,The result is a joyful session of imaginary collaboration, with bass lines, drums, melodies and effects tracks all on different time loops creating an ""improvised"" jam that lasts more than three days before repeating in the same order.,""They both took the model of U.S. hip hop … but then incorporated a local idiom with that,"" said Douglas of the U.K. and Egyptian music. ""In the piece, a third idiom comes out of that through [the imaginary ISDN] collaboration. Your mind makes connections where there may not be any."",Douglas, 61, studied at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver and now spends half his time in L.A., where he's chair of the graduate program at the ArtCenter College of Design. ,He has spent a career making photographs, film and most recently theatre exploring failed utopias and alternative histories as they relate to urbanism, technology and post-colonialism.,He uses elaborate techniques for his photographs. Shoots can last days, in which dozens of actors are photographed on a soundstage, sometimes one at a time, and then composited together with a digital plate shot of the location.,Douglas has a strong fanbase both in the world of art and film.,""It's interesting to look at world history through four photos and [process] all that happened and what became of it,"" said German art curator Bettina Steinbruegge, referring to ,. ,""And then you see the rap musicians, which is very political and a younger generation. It's a good way to look at what's happening, all the turmoil. We are living in a world that is changing rapidly and is quite aggressive, and I think he captured it very well."",Mark Peranson, publisher of the Canadian film magazine Cinema Scope, is equally enthusiastic.,""The way he composes the video stylistically with the reiterations of the algorithm works really well with rap music,"" he said. ""Because there's not a strict narrative [with rap], it worked. And the music is great."",Reid Shier, the curator of the Canada pavilion in Venice and part of the three-person committee through the National Gallery of Canada that selected Douglas to represent Canada, calls him an incredibly generous and accessible artist.,""If you walk into , and don't know anything about Stan Douglas or contemporary art, you're going to be met with a work that is about an experience of listening to music in real time,"" he said. ""It's not something you have to come in and read like a long, didactic panel to understand. You can get it visually, sensorially, audially, in so many different ways, and that's incredible maturity."",While race is a consistent element in Douglas's work, it's not explicitly autobiographical and usually part of a larger exploration of post-colonialism.,His 1991 short, ,, features a white man mistakenly calling a Black man he passes on the street Gary, a commentary on racial invisibility. In ,(2005), Douglas reflects the experience of a Black, working-class Cuban.,He says he's had an abiding interest in race, but has resisted showing it from a purely regional perspective, citing another early work, ,(1995), which features an African German character whose experience is closer to his own.,He's ""kind of an outsider figure,"" which is similar to Douglas's experience ""growing up in Vancouver with a majority-white population."",Douglas says this year's Venice show has been the most fun so far — he's been here enough to know what to expect, and to be able to relax. But he bristles at the idea of  ""representing Canada"" as the country's official artist this time around.,""I have a problem with the idea of identity, so in representing Canada, I'm not representing Canada — I'm representing international interconnectedness,"" he said, a point made in his work.,""I identify as Canadian, but I don't want to say, 'This is what Canada is.' I have no idea of what that is. To produce a national myth about what Canada is, is not really feasible. Unlike the U.S., that's all held together by people who can't stand each other but who love their constitution, their revolution or whatever it was. In Canada, we don't have those unifying myths."",While Canada may not have unifying myths, one could argue it has a certain unifying mode of expression that, even in the big-ego world of contemporary art, shuns hyperbole and self-aggrandizement.,When asked if he's surprised about how well his career as an artist has gone, Douglas laughs. ,""Oh yeah, I never thought I would not have to have a job,"" he said. ""When I was coming up, the expectation of having [an art] career was very low, especially as a Canadian."",He pauses, then gives an understated — one could say quintessentially Canadian — explanation for his success.,""Lucky. Right place, right time."""
"2 female MLAs allege premier's conduct intimidating, seek ruling from Speaker","Two MLAs are accusing Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston of abusive behaviour meant to intimidate opposition members, particularly women.,Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin, who has sat as an Independent since being , for participating in a blockade of the Trans-Canada Highway last summer, has asked Speaker Keith Bain to rule on whether her former leader's behaviour was meant to intimidate her.,She said after she complained about what she considered the premier's attempt to influence the chair of a committee during debate, Houston lobbed an insult her way ""loud enough for everyone in the chamber to hear"".,""He made a derogatory comment meant to intimidate and meant to embarrass me,"" said Smith-McCrossin. ""It was very upsetting."",""It makes me feel uncomfortable to even come in this chamber to know that there are things being said and done to purposely intimidate me, which I do feel affects my ability to work effectively and confidently to represent the people of Cumberland North."",According to former Liberal cabinet minister Kelly Regan, Houston shouted, ""Why don't you block another highway?"" Smith-McCrossin confirmed that's what she heard too.,But as MLAs filed out of the chamber after the sitting officially ended late Friday, Houston flatly denied that's what he said.,""No, I did not,"" he said. ""Listen, look, tensions are always high in the House, particularly at the end of the sessions."",""Session's over. It was a productive session. Lots of legislation passed and budget passed. We're going to leave on a high note."",Asked what he did say to Smith-McCrossin, Houston responded, ""Look, things happen in the chamber and things get said back and forth,"" he said.,""We closed the session and it's a good day and we're going home and back to our constituencies."",In a separate but related incident, Regan has officially complained to the Speaker about the way a PC cabinet minister treated her and others.,Smith-McCrossin left the chamber after the disagreement with Houston. Regan joined her with another Liberal, Patricia Arab.,The three were speaking when Economic Development Minister Susan Corkum-Greek walked by and called the women a ""coven,"" or gathering of witches.,The cabinet minister admitted doing that and publicly apologized for the remark yesterday.,""I take full responsibility for my actions,"" said Corkum-Greek. ""My greatest disappointment is in myself to have allowed myself to be caught up in the moment here.,""I know that I did not conduct myself as my best self in the person I wish to be and for that I am very apologetic."",Regan acknowledged that apology, but also put the blame for what happened on Houston.,""I do accept her apology, but what I don't accept is what led up to that because I do feel that by the continuous actions of the premier in doing things like directing chairs in their duty or by doing things like yelling things at a member with whom he has a [personal] beef, he is trying to intimidate members of this House,"" Regan said on the floor of the chamber.,Houston brushed off the accusations and the appeal to the Speaker.,""There's lots of points of order during the session,"" he said. ""It's just the way of the legislature. People see opportunities, they try to take them but I'm just very focused on Nova Scotians."",Last fall, after a similarly raucous sitting, ,""Everyone's getting a little bit cranky, I would say. I made a commitment on the floor of the House and I'll make that anywhere else that, as premier, I have a responsibility to set the standard and I'll do better to raise the decorum in the House, as well,"" said Houston last October.,During that sitting ,The premier and Corkum-Greek were not the only MLAs whose conduct was called into question during this spring's sitting.,Liberal MLA Brendan Maguire apologized to Community Services Minister Karla MacFarlane following comments he made directed at her during budget debate.,Since the spring sitting has come to an end, Speaker Keith Bain's ruling on the complaints against Houston and Corkum-Greek won't come until the fall sitting."
How a Canadian film is animating the difficult story of an underappreciated artist," co-director Tahir Rana will admit that he did not know who Charlotte Salomon was until he saw a script about her life — a Jew who fled Nazi Germany only to end up in Vichy France, and whose discovery of a family history of suicide and mental illness prompted a series of autobiographical paintings that would outlive her.,""Charlotte sort of felt that the walls were closing in on her,"" said Rana. Her response was to make art. ,The Canadian director felt compelled to make this story come to life. ,""I begged and pleaded to get the opportunity to work on the film,"" the Mississauga-based director said. ""Once I read the script … I realized what an extraordinary life she led and this story was ... so valuable to tell."", Her story is now being told in an animated film set to release in theatres today. ,One person who has long known Salomon's story is the film's producer Julia Rosenberg. When Rosenberg was 13, she received a copy of Salomon's ,which she says many consider to be the first graphic novel.,""Charlotte's work was really important to me. And over the years, I would offer it as a gift to certain people who came into my life who were important to me,"" Rosenberg said.,The idea for the film came to her one morning when she was out for a run. ""I had the idea that Charlotte Salomon drew her life story. So I needed to produce a drawn version of her life story as well,"" she said.,Ten years after that morning run, , is ready for release. Along the way the animated feature, which played at TIFF last year and stars Kiera Knightley, became a Canadian-French-Belgian co-production.  ,Born in Berlin in 1917, Salomon's life was marked by tragedy; her namesake aunt died by suicide before she was born, as did her mother when she was a young girl. ,She was able to enroll in the State Art Academy of Berlin in 1936, despite restrictions that allowed only 1.5 per cent of the school to be Jewish. Around January 1939, Salomon was sent to be with her maternal grandparents in the south of France in order to escape Nazi Germany.  ,Learning about her family history of mental illness and suicide while living in southern France prompted Salomon to create ,an autobiographical work comprised of 769,of the more than 1,200 gouaches she painted in a matter of months. ,""She was very hurried, almost kind of had the idea that her time on this Earth was limited, that there [were] forces coming to get her,"" Rana said. ""I like the way that Charlotte used her artistic talent to sort of triumph over those forces that were coming to get her and that she left behind a legacy for herself."",In 1943, at age 26 and five months pregnant, Salomon was taken with her husband by the German Gestapo from the south of France and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where she was killed, more than likely on the day she arrived. ,A few months prior, she had entrusted her artworks to her doctor, and they eventually found their way back to Salomon's father and stepmother, who survived the war.,Using animation to tell a story dealing with suicide, ethnic violence,and war presented Rana with what he called a rare opportunity, at least on this continent.,While he says Japan and countries in Europe have long used animated films as a medium for telling dark, mature stories, Rana notes that in North America, animation isn't often used in adult dramas.,""There's a lot of tools in the toolkit that an animator can use in terms of conveying emotion and expression and colour palette."",The film included real examples of Salomon's art, and Rana was able to take other inspiration from her work. ""Charlotte never used the colour black in her painting, so we never used it in her film,"" he noted.,Belief in the power of animation as a storytelling tool is a sentiment that Rosenberg shares. She cites , as another recent example of an animated film telling a story containing heavy subject matter.,centred on the story of Amin Nawabi and his flight from Afghanistan to Denmark as a refugee.  It was nominated for best documentary feature film, best international feature film, and best animated film at the most recent Academy Awards., ""I think the big message is that animation is a medium, not a genre. And so hopefully audiences, by exposing themselves to other types of stories told through animation, will, will come to it,"" she said.,Ilana Zackon, who writes for the Canadian Jewish News, saw the film while she was living with a 98-year-old relative and Holocaust survivor. ,""I'd been hearing all of his stories about his experiences surviving Auschwitz and then watched this movie. And it kind of hit me in a much deeper way,"" she told CBC News.,Zackon believes it's important that stories like , continue to be seen and shared today.,""I think a lot of people think anti-Semitism ended when the Holocaust ended, and that's very inaccurate,"" she said.  ,As the Holocaust fades from living memory, the importance of art grows, says Zackon.,""When we don't have survivors to tell their stories … [art] allows [the] audience to feel like an emotional reaction in a way that you wouldn't get from other means."" ,Rana feels Charlotte Salomon's life story is reflected in today's world as well.,""Her story, to me, it really resonates now, even as a refugee story, as, you know, somebody who's been marginalized because of her religion and her race. These are themes that are still echoing in the world today, unfortunately."""

"As Ukrainian students arrive in Canada, experts urge schools to be welcoming, culturally informed","Oksana Kosteckyj is keeping careful watch over the Ukrainian children who joined R.F. Morrison Elementary this month, making sure they and their families feel welcome at the Winnipeg school. ,There, this week, young newcomers joined in on holiday activities — like making loaves of , (braided yeast bread) — while sitting in classrooms colourfully decorated in anticipation of Orthodox Easter this weekend. ,""You could tell that [the situation is] new for them, but the fact that there's Ukrainian speakers around them, you can see that they're smiling,"" noted Kosteckyj, Morrison's vice-principal.,""That welcoming environment in terms of language and culture, you could just see the relief in them — and in their parents … knowing that they're coming to a school that can support their kid's education but can also support them in terms of language and culture."" ,Since the federal government unveiled, as temporary residents in mid-March, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada,. Since the beginning of the year, more than 19,000 Ukrainian citizens or Canadian permanent residents of Ukrainian origin have arrived, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.,As this new wave of newcomers arrives, educators and settlement workers are highlighting what's needed to support refugee students to continue school successfully in Canada. ,Here's what they told CBC News.,Nearly a dozen Manitoba schools offer a Ukrainian-English bilingual program and, with R.F. Morrison having the largest enrolment, it's in a unique position to welcome children from Ukraine. ,Providing a supportive environment with clear, regular structure — the school, for instance, matched recent newcomers with Ukrainian-speaking Canadian peers who help guide them through their daily classes — is a starting point ""that goes a long way to support kids going through any sort of difficulty,"" Kosteckyj said.  ,In May, there is a professional development day scheduled for all of Manitoba's Ukrainian bilingual teachers, with a specific session led by a counsellor ""to talk about how to recognize trauma, how to support trauma and how to have a trauma-informed practice at school,"" she noted. ,Come fall, plans are underway for the counsellor to return for another session aimed at those teaching in Ukrainian, as well as those teaching in English. ,Another valuable strategy is to liaise with settlement service teams in the community. At R.F. Morrison, settlement workers are slated to begin ""an after-school program for these kids to socialize, to be together, to invite friends to,"" Kosteckyj said. ,Maryam Karimi also encourages educators to seek out settlement service experts who work across the country. Specifically, there are Settlement Worker in Schools (SWIS) programs supporting families new to Canada; they can help enrol children into Canadian schools or act as interpreters or translators during meetings with school officials.,""Schools are doing their best most of the time, I am aware of that. But there are definitely gaps,"" said Karimi, a SWIS co-ordinator in Saskatoon.,""We need to see that schools are more welcoming, definitely more inclusive and work with settlement agencies to provide culturally responsive services."",While some school divisions and boards have been proactive in collaborating with settlement service providers to help new students integrate, she thinks more should be reaching out. ,Karimi calls SWIS teams a valuable resource that, beyond helping with language challenges, can also offer guidance on hardships newcomers have faced before arriving in Canada, share culturally relevant information and help educators more effectively engage and communicate with parents.,""[Settlement workers] are a bridge between schools and families,"" Karimi said. ,""[Students] need to have a sense of belonging. They need to feel 'home' ...  And when we are aware of the needs of our students and we provide those information and supports for them based on their needs, then we can say we are successful communities."" ,Teachers should actively listen to and learn from refugee students — as well as challenge their own personal biases by not making assumptions, according to Snežana Ratković,, in St. Catharines, Ont. ,Learning to speak and write in English is indeed a priority, but teachers shouldn't be ""obsessed"" with lack of English as a defining flaw since, depending on the student, it may be their second, third or even fourth language, noted Ratković, who came to Canada herself as a refugee from the former Yugoslavia. ,She encourages educators to find ways to highlight or acknowledge a newcomer's strengths, including using non-verbal ways of expression and learning — things like visual arts, music, photography or digital storytelling.,""It's not only about reading and writing English, it is about expressing, about engaging in different ways."" ,Like Kosteckyj and Karimi, she also advocates reaching out to and partnering with families and community groups.,For Ratković, it's a way for educators to build stronger relationships with newcomer students and to get support in acknowledging their cultures, stories and values within the classroom.  ,""That's critical because students have to recognize themselves in the curriculum [and] in the classroom to be able to develop a sense of belonging. And without that sense of belonging, it's really hard to do anything else — to teach or to learn,"" she said.,Ideally, the researcher also wants to see more national conversations and the sharing of information about educational initiatives, methods, policies and the ""great things that people are doing in different provinces"" to support refugee students.,As Canadian educators, ""[we're] still trying to figure out what is the best, but I think the exciting thing is that there are so many options and there are so many people — teachers, administrators, scholars and the public — focusing on these topics and trying to figure out the best way to approach it,"" Ratković said.,""Schools, they have the potential to be healing spaces for refugee students."" "
"As Poilievre's events draw big crowds, Charest says he's focused on boosting membership","Conservative leadership candidate Jean Charest says his focus in the race is on signing up new party members and putting forth policy proposals — not drawing big crowds to rallies.,Some observers have questioned the health of Charest's campaign in recent days after seeing images from some of his campaign events showing only a few dozen people in attendance. The perceived front-runner, Pierre Poilievre, has been drawing thousands of supporters to some of his rallies.,""Didn't Mr. Bernier also have big crowds?"" said Charest, referring to the former Conservative leadership hopeful who went on to found the People's Party of Canada.,""Now, as far as I know, Mr. Bernier does not have a seat in the House of Commons, neither he nor anyone else from his party.,""Don't be misled. This is about memberships."",On two separate occasions in the past week, CBC journalists asked Charest's campaign about taking cameras to upcoming campaign events. They were told his events were for party members and were not open to the media.,Candidates Poilievre, Leslyn Lewis and Roman Baber, meanwhile, have sent out media advisories for some of their campaign gatherings and have invited reporters, photographers and camera crews to attend. Candidate Patrick Brown has not been sending out media advisories.,CBC News asked Charest whether the decision to close his events to the general public was linked to questions about the size of his audiences.,The former Quebec premier said that he is holding public events. Charest's director of communications later issued a statement saying that members of the media can attend his gatherings.,""All of Mr. Charest's member events are open to the public but members and new members are the focus and priority of these events,"" said Michelle Coates Mather.,""These events are open to media. We have had local media attend previous events and they are welcome to continue to do so, but there is no interview availability or scrum during these events as we don't want to take time away from members."",Charest's events are usually posted on Facebook and invitations are emailed to potential attendees, said Coates Mather.,While the media presence at his events has been limited, Charest certainly has managed to make headlines during the race.,He has been interviewed by national media outlets many times. He drew particularly intense media attention when he said Poilievre should be ""disqualified"" from becoming prime minister because of the Ottawa MP's support for the trucker convoy that protested vaccine mandates and occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks.,Charest also has released a series of policy proposals — to increase the role of the private sector in health care, to boost military funding and to help more families pay for child care.,All the candidates are running their campaigns their own way, said Charest. He also pointed out that the front-runners in the last two Conservative leadership races — Bernier and former cabinet minister Peter MacKay — both lost.,""I'm the underdog in this campaign. I'm delighted to be the underdog. That's what I have been all my life,"" he said.,""I have never been about winning polls. I win election campaigns and I will win this leadership."",Poilievre, meanwhile, has welcomed media attention for recent events that have attracted big audiences.,He's also released some policy, putting a particular emphasis on improving access to housing. ,Poilievre has called for Canada to embrace cryptocurrencies and has said he would seek to build more pipelines, repeal legislation he views as anti-energy sector and defund the CBC.,The 42 year-old has embraced social media to get out his message, but he's been more selective about accepting interviews with journalists.,During the campaign, he's talked to major mainstream media outlets in Quebec, but in English-speaking Canada his interviews with national media have been limited to those with conservative leanings.,In her second campaign for the leadership, Lewis has also been touring the country and taking questions from supporters.,Known for her socially conservative views that include limiting access to abortion, Lewis has put up a handful of blog posts that address specific issues.,She said she wants to pass a law protecting parental rights, arguing that ""many parents are afraid of even having conversations with their children about certain subjects."",Lewis also recently objected to Canada signing a proposed World Health Organization treaty on pandemic preparedness. She argued that by doing so, Canada would sign away its health care sovereignty.,In an appearance this week on CBC's ,, Lewis was pressed repeatedly to explain how she can claim Canada risks giving up its sovereignty when the document has not yet been drafted.,Brown seems to be taking a more low-profile approach to the race. He is working the phones relentlessly and doing between ten and 12 events each day, said campaign co-chair and MP Michelle Rempel Garner.,Those events are not set up like a typical campaign rally, she said.,""The structure is to get people to sign up as membership sales captains and then encourage them to state a number of people that they feel like they can bring into the party,"" she said.,Brown recently tweeted photos of himself in Calgary meeting with the Nepali community, speaking at the Canada Arab Vote dinner and meeting with members of Regina's Muslim community.,""If we want to be a party that's ready to govern, our membership should reflect Canada's diversity,"" said Rempel Garner.,Brown has done few interviews with national media outlets. ,The public will have a chance to compare the various candidates' approaches when the party holds two official debates next month. The English-language debate is set for May 11 in Edmonton and the debate in French will take place May 25 in the Montreal suburb of Laval.,The final vote to choose a new leader is being held Sept 10."
Cancer taught me the hard truth about speaking up for myself,"Nobody forgets the moment they learn they have cancer.,For me, it was early December as I drove from Montreal to Ottawa. Clear road, caffeine in hand, sing-along tunes blaring, the day couldn't get any better.,It didn't.,A call from my doctor's office interrupted my music, so I hit the button on the steering wheel to answer. The nurse got straight to the point: ""So, Jennifer, I am just following up about your upcoming appointment at the cancer clinic."" This was the first I'd heard of it. ,It wasn't the first time I'd wondered if the health-care system was listening to women like me.,The word cancer has gripped me from the time I was a Little. I remember visiting my great-grandmother and stopping short of kissing her cheek, which was covered in a yellow goo encased in crust.,Later, the Littles listened as the Bigs gossiped.,, they whispered.,, I asked.,.,After Great-Grammy died, cancer took shape in my developing mind as a murderous villain that eats you from within until you get lemon-meringue-face and die. From the Bigs, there was no reassurance forthcoming that cancer was something people could survive or manage or live with.,There really isn't a good time or place to receive cancer news but hurtling down a highway at 120 km/h is perhaps the worst.,Or perhaps it was meant to be. After all, it came almost exactly a year after another noteworthy car experience that had brought me to this point.,When I became a Big, I counselled women with cancer at The Ottawa Hospital. Their courage awed me but their losses hurt. Determined to improve my own mental health while assisting with theirs, I started a professional practice that allowed me to see clients in their homes. ,As another tool to help me cope with the stress of my work, I reprogrammed my car radio to music stations, deciding to embrace singing behind the wheel instead of listening to sad stories and negative news.,Until one very lucky day when I didn't.,The first thing I heard was a man's voice saying, ""She was 49 when she found a lump."" ,Forty-nine. That was my age.,The story on , was about Lucy van Oldenbarneveld, a longtime Ottawa CBC broadcaster, who survived breast cancer by finding it early, while devastated by the loss of her sister to the same disease.,From their story emerged another, about current Ontario breast screening guidelines and mounting evidence challenging their position that 50 is the best age to start screening.,After the radio program ended, I called my husband and told him that I was getting a mammogram.,Initially, I assumed getting a mammogram would be easy. I was wrong. What I thought would be a couple of calls and a short doctor's visit ended up being a months-long endeavour.,And that made all the difference.,After my diagnosis, I learned about ,pointing to the benefits of screening before age 50 and problems with research that suggested it was unnecessary — even harmful — to screen earlier.,My cancer journey has been marked by many life-altering coincidences, including a connection to Dr. Jean Seely, professor of radiology at The Ottawa Hospital, head of breast imaging and , identifying significant flaws in the research that guides our current national screening guidelines — guidelines that recommend against screening women before 50.,Seely was responsible for the biopsy that confirmed my cancer. ,She was also one of the women featured on the radio program that prompted me to get a mammo in the first place.,My experience, which I'm sure is not unique, has been neither easy nor comfortable. But despite the difficulties, diagnosis and treatment, cancer has forced me to confront my fears, speak up for myself and accept that courage doesn't avoid discomfort. ,It relies on it."
10-year-old Algonquin girl shares the traditional skills she's learned on social media,"How do you know the difference between a female and male partridge? Just look at the colouring on its tail, says Sigon Nottaway.,Identifying partridge is just one of the many lessons that the bubbly 10-year-old Algonquin girl has made for family and friends through her mother's social media.,""It's just who I am,"" said Sigon, who is a member of the Algonquins of Barriere Lake and lives in Maniwaki, Que., about 120 kilometres north of Ottawa.,""I always watch tutorials and I thought that I could make my own."",So far, she's made many videos on how to clean and identify partridges, as well as a step-by-step process on how to make maple syrup. Intertwined throughout is a lesson on the importance of conservation.,""My dad always taught me when I'm hunting, never get too excited, never show off,"" she said.,""It's disrespectful to the animals because you don't take an animal if you don't need it. You take it when you really need it and when you want food."",Being far from camera shy, the videos are a way for Sigon to practise her performng chops while sharing valuable cultural knowledge about hunting, trapping, and fishing.,""That's what she loves to do,"" said her mother Tina Nottaway.,Like many youth her age, Sigon spends her time watching videos on YouTube and recreating viral TikTok dances. ,With aspirations to be an actress and model, she has plans to travel to Los Angeles this summer to attend the International Presentation of Performers, a talent promotion event that brings hopefuls wanting their big break together with agents and managers. ,""I'm excited to be acting there and just show 'em what I got,"" said Sigon.,For her mom, the trip will be an important opportunity to showcase her daughter's many interests and talents.,""The more she's out there, the more she can bring to other people,"" said Tina.,""We live in a very small community and there's not much opportunity for anything like this. It's hard to find anything for them to participate in just to be themselves."",Rakwirenhtha Diabo, a Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) elder from Kahnawake, south of Montreal, was a facilitator for a program that offered activities to youth based on traditional culture and teachings. Every year, they'd spend a week in Algonquin territory with Nottaway's family.,He said it's important for youth to grow up learning traditional skills, and he watched how Sigon quickly began teaching youth twice her age. He was also impressed by her videos.,""When I saw those videos… I said 'holy Moses,' I was amazed. She's already a presenter,"" said Diabo.,""She's been this natural teacher ever since she was growing up. I couldn't believe it. That gave me really some insight into the endless possibilities of our children."",For Sigon, she just wants to share what she's learned with others.,""I just want to teach and inspire people, and show them what I can do."""
Ukraine reports Russian forces attempting to storm Mariupol steel plant,"An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office says Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last defence stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city of Mariupol.,Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that Russian forces have resumed airstrikes on the Azovstal iron and steel works and were trying to storm it.,""The enemy is trying to completely suppress resistance of the defenders of Mariupol in the area of Azovstal,"" Arestovich said.,Arestovich's statement came two days after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been ""liberated"" by the Russians.,Putin ordered the Russian military not to storm the plant and instead to block it off in an apparent attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there.,Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant, along with about 1,000 sheltering in the facility's underground tunnels.,Arestovich said the Ukrainian fighters were still holding on despite the resumed attacks and were trying to counter them.,Women and children are said to be holding out in the underground bunkers of the steel complex. In a video released by Ukraine's Azov Battalion on Saturday, they said they wanted to return home to their families.,The video showed women wearing the Azovstal uniform design, which Reuters verified, matched in file images. Reuters could not independently verify where or when the video was shot.,Mariupol has been reduced largely to smoking rubble by weeks of bombardment, and Russian state TV showed the flag of the pro-Moscow Donetsk separatists raised on what it said was the city's highest point, its TV tower. It also showed what it said was the main building at the Azovstal steel plant in flames.,Under cover of darkness, Ukrainian forces have managed to deliver weapons to the besieged steelworks via helicopter, said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council.,Russian troops, meanwhile, continue to fight for full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine. They seek to secure ""a land route between these territories and the occupied Crimea"" by wiping out the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Ukraine's General Staff said in its morning update.,Ukrainian forces over the past 24 hours repelled eight Russian attacks in the two regions, destroying nine tanks, 18 armoured units and 13 vehicles, a tanker and three artillery systems, the General Staff said.,""Units of Russian occupiers are regrouping. Russian enemy continues to launch missile and bomb strikes on military and civilian infrastructure,"" the General Staff said on its Facebook page.,Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said on Saturday that two people were killed by Russian shelling in the city of Popasna.,""In addition to the fact that street fighting continues in the city for several weeks, the Russian army constantly fires at multi-storey residential buildings and private houses,"" Haidai wrote on the messaging app Instagram. ""Just yesterday, local residents withstood five enemy artillery attacks. Not all survived,"",Britain's Ministry of Defence said despite their increased activity, ""Russian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder the efforts."",Russia still has not established air or sea control due to Ukrainian resistance, and despite the Russian president's declaration of victory in Mariupol, ""heavy fighting continues to take place, frustrating Russian attempts to capture the city, thus further slowing their desired progress in the Donbas,"" the Ministry of Defence said.,Overall, the Kremlin has thrown more than 100,000 troops and mercenaries from Syria and Libya into the fight in Ukraine and is deploying more forces in the country every day, Danilov said.,""We have a difficult situation, but our army is defending our state,"" he said.,The latest satellite photos from Maxar Technologies revealed what appeared to be a second mass grave site near Mariupol. The site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne has several newly dug parallel trenches measuring about 40 metres long, Maxar said in a statement.,A day earlier, Maxar released photos of what appeared to be rows upon rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves next to a cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside Mariupol. That prompted Ukrainian accusations that the Russians are trying to conceal the slaughter of civilians in the city.,""This confirms again that the occupiers arrange the collection, burial and cremation of dead residents in every district of the city,"" Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said on the Telegram messaging app.,The Ukrainians estimated that the graves seen in the photos released on Thursday could hold 9,000 bodies. The Kremlin did not respond to the satellite pictures.,More than 100,000 people — down from a pre-war population of about 430,000 — are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, and more than 20,000 civilians have been killed in the nearly two-month siege, according to Ukrainian authorities.,Most attempts to evacuate civilians from the city have failed because of what the Ukrainians said was continued Russian shelling."
Returning land and staving off decay: What the transfer of the Bay building means to Winnipeg,"There are months, years and even decades where Winnipeg never seems to change. Such is life in a slow-growth city that's been struggling to regain momentum for more than a century after its initial railway-boom success rusted away.,Friday was not one of those classically static Winnipeg days.,The Hudson's Bay Co.'s transfer of its former downtown flagship department store to the Southern Chiefs' Organization signalled an immense amount of change — both in terms of the pace of returning important parcels of land to Indigenous ownership, and the degree to which Winnipeg's leaders will tolerate the continuing decay of the inner city.,On the decolonization front, the transfer of the six-storey former Bay building is significant both symbolically and in concrete terms.,The HBC, more than any other commercial enterprise in the history of North America, was responsible for opening up the northwestern quadrant of this continent to European settlement. ,The effect on the Indigenous peoples of this continent was disastrous, as HBC governor Richard Baker acknowledged in candid terms during Friday's transfer ceremony.,""While we are proud of our longevity, HBC played a definitive role in the colonization of Canada. The impact of our company's history is not at all lost on me,"" said Baker, citing centuries of efforts to displace Indigenous peoples from their lands and eradicate their cultures and identities.,""These things cannot be remedied by a single action, a single promise, or a single speech,"" Baker continued.,""They demand real effort from everyone — the state, the church, businesses and the society as a whole to facilitate much-needed healing. We must meet our words with actions."",And with that, the Bay's former Winnipeg flagship, a 650,000-square-foot behemoth of a building that occupies one of the most prominent corners of the inner city, is in the hands of the 34 Manitoba Anishinaabe and Dakota nations represented by the Southern Chiefs' Organization.,""It's more than a building. It's about the people in this building,"" said SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels, referring to the amenities planned for the $130-million redevelopment.,They include hundreds of housing units for SCO members, social services such as a health centre, and businesses serving the general public, including a redeveloped Paddlewheel restaurant.,""I think we're turning the page into what real reconciliation means,"" said Daniels, adding he hopes other businesses across Canada will follow the HBC's example.,At the same time, the HBC was highly motivated to dispose of the property to a willing and responsible developer.,If HBC retained ownership of the store it shuttered in 2020, it would have been responsible for maintaining its heritage elements, even with no revenue coming in to pay for bare-minimum building maintenance.,The three levels of government were not prepared to let the six-storey monolith sit empty in perpetuity, the way other heritage buildings have languished in and around downtown Winnipeg.,Both the James Avenue Pumping Station and the Metropolitan Theatre, for example, stood empty for decades before private owners came forward with viable redevelopment plans.,The consequences of the same thing happening to a piece of real estate as large as the Bay were far more significant.,The department store was barely shuttered before the city tasked downtown development officials with brainstorming ideas for the building.,""What I didn't want to see is what happened at the Met, where it sat vacant for a generation,"" Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman told reporters Friday.,Within months, former Manitoba premier Brian Pallister announced $25 million in redevelopment funding. His successor, Heather Stefanson, topped that up on Friday with $10 million more for the housing component.,The federal Liberal government has come to the table with a $55-million forgivable loan and another $10-million loan that must be repaid. ,The city is also being asked to improve the streetscaping around the Bay and forgo future property tax revenue emanating from the project.,But questions remain about the rest of the financing for the project, which appears to be $30 million short of its $130-million goal only months before the three-year construction project is slated to begin.,Daniels would not say on Friday whether SCO has raised any money of its own beyond what it has spent on planning.,It's also unclear what entity will be responsible for covering any additional costs, should the project exceed the $130-million price tag.,""The government wouldn't be giving us $100 million if we didn't have a plan,"" Daniels quipped.,To be clear, even if only half of what SCO has planned for the former Bay comes to fruition, it would improve upon an empty shell of a building.,Besides, the downtown Bay has always been something of a gamble.,When the massive department store opened in 1926, Winnipeg was already skidding toward the Great Depression. The city's initial meteoric growth had been stunted by the First World War, the inconclusive resolution of the Winnipeg General Strike and the reduction of railway subsidies. ,The Bay's location was also questionable, given that most of Winnipeg's early downtown development was concentrated along Main Street. The opening of Eaton's on Portage Avenue in 1905 stretched out the city's commercial core; the Bay expanded it further into an L-shaped dogleg two decades later.,In many ways, Winnipeg is still struggling to maintain its oversized downtown. Seventy years of suburban development and an inadequate public transit system have not helped the situation.,On its own, the transfer of the Bay to the SCO won't save downtown any more than it will right the wrongs of colonization.,But there is no denying the significance of the move — for every resident of this city."
Almost half of Canadians may have caught COVID,"Canada's COVID-19 immunity landscape has completely transformed since the emergence of Omicron — with new estimates suggesting that almost half of the population has been infected.,Researchers in B.C. analyzed thousands of blood samples in the Lower Mainland throughout the pandemic to track antibody levels in the general population, and found a massive shift in the level of infection in the past few months.,The B.C. data, provided in advance to CBC News, found close to 40 per cent of the population had antibodies from a previous infection in March, up from around 10 per cent in October. That number is even higher in children under 10, with nearly two-thirds now showing evidence of prior infection.,""Think about that — two out of three children,"" said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a vaccine effectiveness expert and epidemiology lead at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control who led the research.,""Wow, something really dramatically changed and I think we know the name of that change … it's Omicron."" ,Skowronski said close to 60 per cent of those aged 10 to 40 also had antibodies from prior infection, and just under 50 per cent of those aged 40 to 60. There were slightly lower levels in those aged 60 to 80 — possibly because they were less socially engaged and vaccinated earlier.,The data also suggests almost 90 per cent of the population has had their immune system primed against the virus in some way — either through vaccination, prior infection or both.,Skowronski, whose research , for the decision to delay second doses in Canada, said we are in a ""vastly different context"" now than at the start of the pandemic, when we had basically ""total population naivety"" to the virus.,""It's about one in two, almost, of our population that have had evidence of infection,"" she said. ,And while the data provides a useful snapshot to estimate the level of infection in the community, she said it doesn't directly translate to exact population immunity levels. ,""We cannot say that this is an indication of protection or being exempt from future infections, especially when new variants arise. But a primed person is immunologically a prepared person."",While the data is preliminary and has yet to be peer reviewed or published, it is in line with emerging data from other provinces, like Ontario, where official estimates now show as much as , with COVID-19 since December alone.,""We have had millions of infections in the last few months, most of them undocumented,"" said Dr. David Naylor, who led the federal inquiry into the 2003 SARS epidemic and now co-chairs the federal government's COVID-19 immunity task force.,""I would not be surprised if the true number is over 10 million nationally by the end of the sixth wave."" ,Canada's COVID-19 immunity landscape is one of the most complex in the world due to our high vaccination rates, widespread transmission, delaying and mixing of doses and the fact we've been a magnet for variants — often with ,.,But does the protection we've gained from vaccines, prior infection and combined hybrid immunity mean the worst is behind us? Or could waning immunity to infection, the spread of new variants or some other pandemic curveball threaten another surge in the future?,""If there's a future variant that has infective advantages over Omicron, we can expect it to arrive and spread here,"" Naylor said. ""That much is obvious from the last two years. SARS-CoV-2 goes pretty much everywhere at a brisk clip."",Canada's bold decision to , and , doses of COVID-19 vaccines led to strong protection from hospitalization and death, but the emergence of Omicron and its subvariants rendered them , against infection than previous virus strains.,, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found the effectiveness of just two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines was ""excellent"" against severe outcomes from COVID-19 up until September 2021.,That research follows another ,, and published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, that showed two doses of mRNA vaccines or AstraZeneca ""gave substantial and sustained protection"" against hospitalization from Delta, up to November 2021.,While vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes has held up well, two-dose protection against Omicron infection fell dramatically in December, dropping to just 36 per cent, according to one ,, with boosters raising it to 61 per cent.,That significant hit to our population immunity , and left us highly susceptible to Omicron-fuelled fifth and sixth waves that have since ripped through the population.,Tulio de Oliveira, the director of South Africa's Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, who led the research team that identified subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, said countries like Canada now have ""very complex"" immunity landscapes in the wake of Omicron.,""What that means is that what one country sees with a variant and subvariant may be slightly different from which other countries see,"" he told CBC News in a phone interview. ,""But if population immunity is increased, especially through vaccination and boosting, that still should bode very well against not only Omicron, but potentially any new variant that may emerge."",Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) strongly recommended , earlier this month, and de Oliveira said the most effective way to boost a population is before a new wave of infection starts.,""That's what countries should be concentrating on,"" he said. ""When infection is low, it's a great idea to go into a campaign of a booster for people that have been fully vaccinated, or vaccinated and infected, because then the next wave that comes will be much less deadly."" ,Naylor said our prior infection immunity, combined with the current vaccine coverage, continued rollout of boosters, additional doses for kids and the ""smart use"" of fourth doses in eligible Canadians should provide a ""fairly solid immunity wall for the summer."",""It's prudent to remember, however, that no one predicted Omicron,"" he said. ""And so that immunity wall could still be breached."" ,While a high rate of vaccination and previous infection in Canada doesn't guarantee the worst is behind us, it's clear that it will continue to reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes from COVID-19 for the vast majority of Canadians.,But as the virus continues to evolve into new variants that are light years away from the original strain that the vaccines are targeted to, the push to update the formulations to target Omicron and other variants is top of mind.,""We need broader coverage from the vaccines. Much to my frustration, we're still aiming against a strain that's long, long, long gone,"" said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist and professor at the University of Arizona.,""I understand the practical reality is these are the tools that we have on hand right now, but we're definitely running out of territory in terms of what we can expect these vaccines to do, given how different Omicron is than what the vaccines are aimed against."", announced new findings this week showing that a booster shot designed to target both the Beta variant and the original virus strain generated a better immune response against several other variants, including Omicron.,While that exact formulation will likely never see the light of day, it bodes well for the possibility of tailoring future mRNA shots to target multiple variants. But until we have updated vaccines, immunity from prior infection may work to fill the gap. ,""Given the mismatches of the vaccine with Omicron, almost certainly a prior Omicron infection with BA.1 would confer more protection against Omicron sublineages, like BA.2,"" Bhattacharya said. ,""So the people who recovered from BA.1 are almost certainly in better shape in dealing with BA.2 than someone who just has gotten say a couple of shots of the vaccine in the past,"" he said.,Skowronski said the Canadian population is more immunologically prepared against COVID-19 now than ever before. And if Omicron continues to evolve new variants while close to half of us have been infected with it, there will be some ""cross-protection."",""We can't predict what the subsequent variants may be. They likely will be evolutionarily related, but may not be to Omicron,"" she said, adding COVID-19 vaccines may have to be updated regularly by a team of international experts, much like influenza shots are. ,""The question is, to what?"""
Empire State is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world. Can others follow suit?,"To understand the carbon footprint of cities all over the world, just look at their skylines. ,While industry and transportation have long been labelled as major carbon culprits, some environmental advocates are trying to raise awareness about another troubling source, especially in dense, urban areas — buildings, the multi-level structures that fill many cities.  ,The amount of energy it takes to light, cool, heat and ventilate them can make up a large portion of a city's carbon output. According to a ,, buildings around the world accounted for 37 per cent of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions in 2020. ,""In a city like New York, 70 per cent of our carbon emissions come from buildings,"" said John Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, a New York-based advocacy group that works to help make buildings more sustainable. ,""We tackle the buildings, we solve the planet crisis,"" said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, at an event on Thursday, unveiling a playbook to do just that.  ,The event was on the 80th floor, overlooking New York City's sea of buildings, the very problem that Hochul was talking about. But, more significantly, it was happening at the Empire State Building, which managed to pull off an ambitious feat — convert a building built in 1930 into one of the most energy efficient in the world.  ,""If we can make it happen at the Empire State Building, a historically preserved, pre-war icon, we believe we can make it happen anywhere,"" said Anthony Malkin, CEO of Empire State Realty Trust, the company that owns and operates the Empire State Building. ,After a decade of implementation, the Empire State's ambitious retrofit hit a major milestone last year, reducing its carbon emissions by more than 50 per cent. By 2030, the goal is to be carbon neutral, said Dana Schneider, the director of energy and sustainability at the Empire State Realty Trust, in a news release. ,The company is now releasing the ,, filled with all the lessons of the last 10 years and their plans for the future. ,""Every single piece of this building, we've done something to make it perform better,"" said Schneider.,On the outside, the Empire State Building may still look as it did in the 1930's when it was breaking ground for its height and Art Deco design. But, it now runs in a way that would probably be unrecognizable to its original builders.,Take the triple-paned windows, with krypton and argon molecules injected into the air gap, for extra insulation. The building's 6,514 windows all got the upgrade. Heat loss in the winter months, and heat gain in the summer, are a huge problem for older windows that can drain a building's cooling and heating system.,""We reused 96 per cent of the original glass and frames, and we did it on a window factory we built on the fifth floor. Nothing left the building,"" said Malkin. ,That project was completed in 2010.  ,In 2019, the building completed the world's largest elevator modernization project. All 68 of its elevators have regenerative braking systems. The elevators not only use less power to run, they also generate power as they go up and down, to power other systems in the building. ,In the basement there's another key retrofit, the chiller plant, the centralized system that cools the air for a building. On the surface, Empire State's chiller plant may look as it did in the 1950s, but the software it now runs on will tell you otherwise. ,""So we actually took out all the guts, recycled all the metal and built new guts to the chillers on site,"" said Schneider, who gave CBC News a tour of the building's essential energy-saving upgrades. ,The new system can collect data and be programmed to cool the building's 300,000 metres of space with optimum efficiency. ,""Everything we learned here is given away, because it's not enough if we only succeed in the Empire State Building,"" said Schneider.,That's the point of the playbook, co-developed by the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the agency helping to lead the state's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 per cent by 2050.,The playbook available online for anyone to use breaks down dozens of measures used by the Empire State Building already, plus hundreds of new ideas to support mass retrofits of buildings, including modernizing the electric grid. ,""We are working with the 10 of the largest real estate companies in New York State, who own over 700 big buildings,"" said Janet Josef, a senior executive at NYSERDA.,Josef said that partnership has resulted in a commitment from owners to decarbonize more than 50 million square feet of their existing buildings within the next decade. The state's leaders are hoping their push will realize a projected economic impact of $20 billion US and 100,000 jobs if all buildings in New York follow the playbook. ,""I say welcome to New York's energy future and as goes New York, goes the nation and goes to the world,"" said Hochul.,In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called for a net-zero emission building code by the end of 2024. ,The Canada Green Building Council estimates that about 100,000 large buildings need retrofitting to help the country shrink its carbon footprint.,""The average Canadian probably doesn't know that buildings have a massive contribution to carbon emissions in this country,"" said Thomas Mueller, CEO of the Canada Green Building Council. ""They focus on industry, they focus on cars. The fact is we need action in all three areas."",Some of that action is already legislated in New York. In 2019, the city passed a law that will require large buildings to cap their carbon emissions by 2024, the first municipality in the world to pass such a law. ,Mueller says political will is important but so is private sector support. ,""I want the 25 large commercial real estate owners in Canada to commit to decarbonize their entire building stock over the next 30 years,"" he said. ,For the group gathered at the top floor of the Empire State Building, a day before Earth Day, the hope is for the playbook to reach far beyond New York and empower advocates, worldwide, like Mueller.,""You have the playbook, you have no excuses and you have history awaiting your actions here today,"" said Hochul. "
"Skookum Jim, whose discovery led to the Klondike gold rush, gets a namesake asteroid","A legendary Yukoner received a posthumous honour that's out of this world.,Skookum Jim, also known as Jim Mason, discovered gold in the Bonanza Creek in 1897, leading to the Klondike gold rush. When he died in 1916, he put the fortune he made into a trust to help improve the lives of Indigenous people in the Yukon.,Last week, on the recommendation of the Yukon Astronomical Society, an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter was named after him.,""I think it's great,"" said Zena McLean, Skookum Jim Mason's great grand niece who didn't know her ancestor's name had been submitted.,""Anything that keeps Skookum Jim Mason's name up in public history of the Yukon is important to his remaining nieces and nephews and family."",Skookum Jim Mason was Tagish of the Dak l'a Weidi Clan. The trust fund he established in his will is still in existence today, according to the friendship centre that bears his name in Whitehorse. The interest generated from the fund is used to provide recognition to Indigenous people who have helped their community.,Maria Benoit, Haa Shaa du Hen, or chief, of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation and former executive director of the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre, was very happy to hear the news. Her great grandfather was Skookum Jim Mason's nephew.,""Coming from a First Nation, it's history in the making,"" she said.,The Skookum Jim asteroid is a main belt asteroid. It orbits with other asteroids in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. ,""It takes a little over five years to complete a full orbit around the sun,"" explained Christa Van Laerhoven, president of the Yukon Astronomical Society. ""Its orbit is not quite circular. It's not wildly what we call eccentric. It's not highly uncircular, but just a bit. And it's tilted relative to Earth's orbit by about 15 degrees."",As far as Van Laerhoven knows, it's the second asteroid whose name has a link to the Yukon.,""The only other asteroid that I can find with the Yukon connection is named Klondike,"" she said, adding it's named after two brothers who came up for the Klondike gold rush, made a fortune and donated money to a university in Finland that built a library.,In a quirk of fate, Van Laerhoven said it's the university where the Skookum Jim asteroid was initially discovered.,However, if you're hoping to see the Skookum Jim asteroid, Van Laerhoven said you'll need a telescope. ,""Something fairly large,"" she said, large enough that it wouldn't be easy to bring out in your backyard.,McLean said she hopes that one day, science will be able to identify what the asteroid os made of.,""Wouldn't it be fantastic if it was heavily laden with gold?"" she said with a laugh.,The naming all started with an email from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada to the Yukon Astronomical Society that said they had an opportunity to put some names forward to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which is in charge of naming things in space.,The way the email was worded, Van Laerhoven said, sounded like the IAU wanted to honour someone who had served society well.,""We really felt that if we were going to honour a Yukoner, we wanted to honour Skookum Jim,"" she said.,""We really felt that his presence in Yukon history loomed so large that if we were going to get an asteroid named after a Yukoner, then it really should be him."",The suggestion was put forward in 2018. ,The Yukon Astronomical Society was notified of the honour last week, on April 11.,""I'm absolutely tickled pink that the IAU took our suggestion,"" said Van Laerhoven."
"After months of sacrifice, Black bobsleigh athlete alleges racism in Olympic team selection","After he gave up the gridiron for the ice, Shaquille Murray-Lawrence says his dream to compete for Canada at this year's Beijing Olympics was thwarted by systemic discrimination within Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton.,""I gave this sport everything that I had. I gave my country everything I had. I gave the organization everything I had. I made the ultimate sacrifice and I got screwed in the end,"" said Murray-Lawrence, a former professional football player who was recruited to join the national bobsleigh team two years ago.,Despite posting overall better performance results, Murray-Lawrence says his spot was given to a ""walk-on"" athlete who never even competed with his eventual Olympic teammates until the Beijing Games.,Since joining the team in 2020, Murray-Lawrence has raced for Canada in the four-man bobsleigh event 11 times. As the brakeman and the last man to hop in the sled, he helped push his team to seven gold and two silvers while competing in North America and Europe.,He also helped Canada qualify a third four-man sled for the Beijing Olympics — a rare feat in the sport in which powerhouse Germany was the only other country to do so.,His main rival was Jay Dearborn, another CFL player. A snapshot of how the two stack up against each other is seen in the performance records tracked by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).,Dearborn competed in just five races in the past two years, and his best finish was fifth place in the four-man sled event, racing with Canada's best pilot.,The two athletes have similar profiles — but with one glaring difference.,""When one athlete is white and one athlete is Black, you know, do we see past that? Do we say, 'Oh, no, that's normal.' Or is there something deeply rooted?"" asked Murray-Lawrence.,The allegations of racism are putting BCS under increased scrutiny just weeks after , for its ""toxic culture"" in an open letter signed by 90 current and former national bobsled and skeleton athletes. ,The letter stated that BCS policies had ""deeply held biases, resulting in an environment that is anti-competition … and ensure in many cases that only the athletes who fit into the 'BCS ideal' will ever have the opportunity to compete."",It also called for the resignation of BCS president and CEO Sarah Storey and high-performance director Chris Le Bihan.,Many of the signatories chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution or losing their spot on national teams.,But two other bobsledders, veterans Cynthia Appiah and Neville Wright, are breaking their silence. They tell CBC that Murray-Lawrence is just the latest example of systemic racism within the national bobsled organization.,For Appiah, racism within BCS takes the form of ""microaggressions and snide remarks,"" she said. She said she's seen athletes of colour shortchanged on training, opportunities and even treatments, like physiotherapy and massage, during her more than eight years with the team.,Appiah has pushed her way to gold and bronze at elite World Cup events as a brakewoman and is currently ranked third in the world in women's monobob, following an eighth place finish at the Beijing Olympics.,""It's hard not to see patterns emerge, where certain people are given preferential treatment over others. And at times, those that aren't being given opportunities tend to be athletes of colour. Black athletes,"" she said.,Three-time Olympian Neville Wright, who was on the team for nearly a decade before retiring in 2018, said he's experienced overt racism in his career, being called ""garbage"" and ""trash"" and left off teams despite good performances. A top team official once accused him of stealing a helmet after his coach told him to get a spare from the equipment shed, he said.,Looking back, Murray-Lawrence says different standards were applied to him from the moment he joined the national team.,In the fall of 2020, BCS recruiters dangled the possibility of competing at Beijing in front of him. Murray-Lawrence says coaches asked him to prove his ""commitment"" by quitting football.,Lured by the dream of representing Canada at the Olympics, Murray-Lawrence walked away from the CFL — even though he was also offered a contract by the Montreal Alouettes as a running back.,For more than a year, he paid for his own flights, accommodations and food during bobsled competitions. His commitment appeared to pay off: in 75 per cent of his races, Murray-Lawrence pushed his sleds to gold or silver.,In January, while competing at an event in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Murray-Lawrence said he was told he would be evaluated against Dearborn. Up until that moment, Murray-Lawrence didn't even know the fellow CFLer — a defensive back who had been playing with the Saskatchewan Roughriders all year — was contending for a spot.,""I compete all year. I win all year. [Dearborn] joins the program with 30 days left and just leapfrogs onto the Olympic team,"" said Murray-Lawrence, noting that BCS hadn't given him the same opportunity to juggle both football and bobsleigh.,""[Dearborn] didn't make any sacrifices. He just showed up at the end of the year and took my job."",In St. Moritz, the two brakemen went head to head in a two-man bobsleigh competition piloted by Austin Taylor. When their push times were compared, Dearborn beat Murray-Lawrence by 0.03 of a second.,Murray-Lawrence says coaches put him through four gruelling practice runs before the evaluation. He says Dearborn only had one.,Not only was fatigue a factor, but Murray-Lawrence also took issue with the qualifying format; it was the first time he had raced two-man in competition.  , CBC reached out to Dearborn multiple times for comment, but did not receive a response.,Murray-Lawrence said several teammates encouraged him to complain to the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada to get his position back. But during arbitration, only one bobsledder, Chris Spring, the pilot of Canada's Sled 2, agreed to testify. ,With the Olympics around the corner, Murray-Lawrence's three teammates on Sled 3 backed out at the last minute.,In his testimony, Spring said it didn't make sense to change the composition of a team so close to the Olympics. When asked who was the superior brakeman, Spring acknowledged they were similar, but said: ""In my opinion, Shaq has more experience with Team Austin (Sled 3), so he would be the better choice."" ,CBC spoke to two other sledders who agreed that Murray-Lawrence should have been on the Olympic team.,The arbitrator ruled in favour of BCS, saying that selecting Dearborn was a ""reasonable"" decision. The report found that BCS ""did not apply its discretionary power in an arbitrary, biased or prejudicial manner,"" and instead, Dearborn's ""versatility simply edged out Murray-Lawrence."",According to BCS, Dearborn had more experience in both two- and four-man races and the coaches wanted the option of using him in both events in Beijing. , Both men had raced in the same number of competitions on the elite World Cup circuit, but Dearborn placed higher while pushing the top-ranked Canadian four-man team. ,However, IBSF stats show that in overall four-man bobsleigh experience, the scales tipped in favour of Murray-Lawrence. He raced 11 times on the larger sled, Dearborn only twice.,At the Beijing Olympics, Murray-Lawrence sat on the sidelines as an alternate and watched as Sled 3 placed 23rd — its worst finish of the season.,BCS president Storey said the team selection is a ""robust process"" and the decision is more complex than the rankings of each athlete.,""There are weight limits, there are combinations, there's riding position.… It's not just about times. There's push, there's speed and other aspects,"" said Storey.,""It's a tough thing to do,"" she said. ""Somebody is always going to be disappointed and that is the nature of high-performance sport."",The organization says it wants to resolve the issues brought forward by its athletes in the open letter and hopes the sledders will participate in an independent, third-party mediation process it has initiated. ,And the trouble at BCS is adding to the turmoil in national sport that has made its way onto the radar of the federal sport minister. Pascale St-Onge's office has received more than 100 complaints from athletes from eight different sporting federations, ranging from bad governance to safety concerns to abuse.,St-Onge says Canada's national sport policy, which was drafted four decades ago, needs to be updated to guard against racism. ""We're going to review and make sure that it's at the forefront of the new Canadian sport policy to make sure that we take action against racism, discrimination,"" she said. ,Sport federations need to have more diversity in their leadership, St-Onge said, noting that organizations that rely on federal funds will be held to account for mismanagement and abuse.,St-Onge said she also wants to ensure Canada's new sport integrity commissioner, Sarah Eve Pelletier, a former synchronized swimmer, will have the resources to fully investigate athlete complaints.,But these changes come too late for Murray-Lawrence. With his Olympic dreams dashed, he's decided to quit bobsledding. ,His days now consist of honing his football skills, with the aim of getting on the roster of another CFL team. And with two years away from the sport, he's hoping that door hasn't closed."

The new reality of 6.7% inflation is that Canadians will be forced to spend less,"Did your boss give you at least a 6.7 per cent raise this year? Can you think of any friends whose bosses did?,As inflation jumped by a whole percentage point last month — up from 5.7 in February to 6.7 per cent in March — Canadians are increasingly being squeezed between the , and a sharp plunge in their spending power.,Bound by contracts that failed to foresee inflation rates approaching seven per cent, or held by wage restraint legislation that limits increases to ,, the number of Canadians who will be forced to cut back is growing.,And that is beginning to be felt throughout the economy; relative luxuries , are already feeling the impact as subscribers look for ways to spend less.,For some, including those who already have every nickel accounted for, it is nothing new, said Shirley Tillotson, a professor emeritus of history at Dalhousie University in Halifax who has studied taxation and inflation.,Those people have had to cut back steadily ,.,""It is genuinely a problem for people on fixed incomes, seniors who have unindexed pensions,"" said Tillotson. ""People who are on social assistance or any other form of public benefit that's not indexed, they're all going to be terribly hard hit."",The problem is that wage increases that don't keep up with inflation have the same effect on your personal finances as an actual cut in income.,Even with a raise of 1.7 per cent — more than some nurses or teachers will get this year — this 6.7-per-cent hike in consumer prices means households will have to shrink their spending by five per cent to even keep treading water.,""You've got to cut back on things that, you know, you don't necessarily need,"" said Adrian Chang, who lives in downtown Toronto and doesn't drive. He said he's noticed the rising cost of food and rent, and plans to go out less as a result.,But for many others, especially those with fixed expenses or the vast majority of Canadians carrying debt, cutting five per cent from their budgets will be hard. It's not just the poorest who spend every penny.,""There is a real reason to be afraid of inflation,"" said Tillotson.,Pulling both from her research and her own personal experience, Tillotson said that for people who have lived through times of sharply rising prices, such as the Second World War or the 1970s and 1980s, just the word inflation scares them.,And historically, governments have been afraid of it, too. Tillotson points to a 1945 National Film Board propaganda film titled ,, which uses what she calls a ""voice of God"" narration to patiently explain how wartime inflation works and how the government was going to fix it.,The difficulty then, just as now, is that inflation is not easy to fix.,While most people can swallow some inflation by dipping into savings or cutting back a bit, this latest increase — a 31-year high — puts a real hole in household spending plans.,It also comes as interest rates have started to rise. And despite a federal rule that those taking out a mortgage must have ,, once the mortgage is obtained, there is nothing to stop borrowers from spending that money or committing to new loans, including lines of credit.,For many mortgage holders, the increase will be invisible, as lenders simply increase the number of years needed to pay the money back — and that means the effects of today's rate increase will stretch long into the future. It is one of the reasons banks tend to do well during times of rising interest rates.,For seniors, there are already signs some ,. For young people, they may try to find a second job or work more hours. And they may save less for their retirements.,Perhaps the worst thing about ballooning costs is that no one can be sure what the future will bring.,While some say there may be signs that ,, including CIBC economist Andrew Grantham, that is far from certain. In the meantime, he said, after the shock of a 6.7-per-cent price increase, expect more and faster interest rate increases.,""The … surprise is likely to bring another non-standard 50-basis-point hike from the Bank of Canada at its next meeting,"" Grantham said in a statement yesterday.,Almost perversely, rising house prices have only a small effect on inflation until rates start to rise. But those sharp interest rate increases come straight back into inflation, because they push up mortgage costs, which then feed straight into the housing component of the consumer price index.,Tillotson is less certain we are over the inflation hump. It is reasonable to expect higher wage demands from organized labour to catch up as union contracts end, she said, but catching up with years of accumulated inflation is hard.,She pointed to the growing conviction that inflation is governed by , — what Tillotson called a ""self-fulfilling prophecy."",But one of the most confusing things of all is that recent world events, including the Russia-Ukraine war and a new backlog in Chinese ports, have compounded the inflationary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.,About a year ago central bankers and many others, including Tillotson, were ,, gone by this August.,""I was part of 'Team Transitory,'"" said Tillotson. ""But now there's this massive shock, and so we're in this period of really hard-to-predict macro forces. And so that's frightening."""
Netflix shares slump 20% after streaming giant reveals it's losing subscribers,"Global streaming giant Netflix Inc. on Tuesday reported losing subscribers for the first time in more than a decade and predicted more contraction in the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has been a reliable growth engine for investors.,Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its modest predictions that it would add 2.5 million subscribers. Its decision in early March to suspend service in Russia after it invaded Ukraine resulted in the loss of 700,000 members. The company's stock plunged 20 per cent in after-market trading.,Netflix, which currently has 221.6 million subscribers, last reported a loss in customers in October 2011. Netflix offered a gloomy prediction for the spring quarter, forecasting it would lose two million subscribers, despite the return of such hotly anticipated series as , and , and the debut of the film ,, starring Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling. ,Revenue rose 10 per cent to $7.87 billion but investor focus stayed on the shrinking customer base.,""The large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently,"" Netflix said, explaining the difficulties of signing up new customers.,The world's dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals like Amazon.com, traditional media companies such as the Walt Disney Co. and the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and cash-flush newcomers like Apple Inc.,Streaming services spent $50 billion US on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That's a 50 per cent increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signaling the quick escalation of the so-called ""streaming wars."",As growth slows in mature markets like the United States, Netflix is increasingly focused on other parts of the world and investing in local language content.,""While hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world's broadband homes don't yet — representing huge future growth potential,"" the company said in a statement.,Netflix has been able to increase subscription prices in the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, to fund content production and growth in other parts of the world, such as Asia, noted Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. However, subscription prices in these growth markets are lower.,Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan warned that the uncertain global economy ""is apt to emerge as an albatross"" for member growth and Netflix's ability to continue raising prices as competition intensifies.,Streaming services are not the only form of entertainment vying for consumers' time. The latest Digital Media Trends survey from Deloitte, released in late March, revealed that generation Z, those consumers ages 14 to 25, spend more time playing games than watching movies or television series at home, or even listening to music.,The majority of gen Z and millennial consumers polled said they spend more time watching user-created videos like those on TikTok and YouTube than watching films or shows on a streaming service.,Netflix, recognizing the shift in consumer entertainment habits, has begun to invest in gaming, but it does not yet contribute materially to the company's revenue."
Canada's inflation rate jumps to new 31-year high of 6.7%,"Canada's inflation rate rose to 6.7 per cent in March, far more than economists were expecting and a full percentage point higher than February's already 30-year high.,Statistics Canada reported Wednesday that all eight categories of the economy that the data agency tracks rose, from food and energy to shelter costs and transportation.,""The spike in prices over the month of March is the largest monthly increase since January 1991, when the goods and services tax was introduced,"" economist Royce Mendes of Desjardins Group noted. ,After years of relative stability, inflation has been on an up and down ride during the pandemic, with rates , when the uncertainty of COVID-19 began, before roaring back in 2021 and beyond due to ,, and ,.,Canada is not the only country grappling with high inflation. In the U.S., the inflation rate hit a ,.,While the cost of just about everything is going up fast, transportation costs are leading the way, up 11.2 per cent in the past year. A big reason for that increase is the 39.8 per cent rise in gasoline costs since March of last year.,Gasoline prices rocketed higher in March mostly due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine throwing global supplies into chaos. Although they have since come down a little, at one point last month numerous Canadian cities saw their average price for a litre of gasoline ,.,High gas prices have an outsized impact on overall inflation because the cost of shipping and transportation gets added to the cost of everything else, from grocery bills (up 8.7 per cent) to the price of durable goods like furniture (up by 13.7 per cent in the past year) and even plane tickets (up by 8.3 per cent.),Prices for furniture jumped by more than eight per cent in the month of March alone. That's the highest monthly increase in that category in more than 70 years.,John Salgueiro, owner of JS Furniture in Winnipeg, has been in business since 1974 and said he's ""never ever seen a situation like this."",""Everything has gone up , absolutely every single thing,"" he said.,A lot of what Salgueiro sells is imported, and the price of those goods has skyrocketed in the pandemic. A container from Asia that used to cost him $4,000 US will likely cost him $20,000 US today.,And that's just the shipping costs. One of his biggest suppliers of bedroom sets just raised their price for the actual merchandise by 15 per cent overnight.,""From the merchandise costs to freight, it's astronomical,"" he said.,Food prices in particular tend to raise the ire of consumers, since it is hard to avoid or lessen the impact of rising prices on something that is such a necessity. But Zainab Williams, a financial planner with Elleverity Wealth Management in Caledon, Ont., says there are ways.,""Meal prepping is your go-to friend right now,"" she told CBC News in an interview. ""You need to have a strategy to see what you can create with what you have in your pantry before replenishing."",She says many of her clients have started using , that help consumers save money while eating well by offering deep discounts on food that's about to reach its best-before date.,""Families are doing a lot of financial acrobatics,"" she said, ""so in this environment, you have to think outside the box."",Karen Peck from Toronto says she's being choosier at the grocery store lately. ""It's tough for everybody right now,"" she said. ""For me personally, I cook a lot more at home."",""Wherever you can save ... a few dollars here and there, it's what you can do."",While the cost of anything that needs to be transported is going up, the service sector isn't immune to the current inflationary pressure.,The overall price for services has increased by 4.3 per cent in the past year, up from 3.8 in February. As TD Bank economist Leslie Preston noted, the main factor there wasn't pump prices; it was the easing of COVID-related health restrictions pushing up demand for close-contact services like restaurant dining and other in-person events.,""Price pressures across other areas of the economy are showing more heat both for goods and services,"" she said. ""Inflation is likely to remain above the Bank of Canada's target range until 2023, crimping consumer purchasing power and driving interest rates higher."",While the vast majority of goods and services got more expensive, a few things have gotten cheaper, although by nowhere near enough to offset the rise everywhere else.,They include a 5.4 per cent decrease in the cost of servicing a mortgage, a 6.2 per cent decline in the cost of car insurance, a 2.5 per cent decrease in the cost of phone bills, and a large decline of 28 per cent in the costs of car registration fees.,But that decline was not felt evenly across the country. The main reason for that drop was the Ontario government's decision to scrap the vehicle registration tax, Statistics Canada noted."
Canada's sport minister vows to leave 'no stone unturned' in tackling toxic sport culture,"In the five months since Pascale St-Onge was appointed Canada's Minister of Sport, there have been allegations of either maltreatment, sexual abuse or misuse of funds levelled against at least eight national sport organizations.,St-Onge is certain there'll be more. Sport, she said, is in ""crisis."",Two days after vowing to accelerate the independent mechanism for reporting maltreatment in sport, St-Onge and Parliamentary Secretary, Adam van Koeverden held a roundtable discussion of Canadian sport leaders and athlete representatives, and in an exclusive interview with The Canadian Press, she said there was a sense of urgency among everyone in attendance.,""It just reinforces my mindset that we need to rethink about the whole system as athlete-centred, and athlete-oriented... I think that what's coming out right now in this crisis is that the athletes haven't felt heard, or sufficiently supported."",On Monday, 70 current and former gymnasts wrote an open letter to Sport Canada calling for an independent investigation into the toxic culture of their sport. The number of signatories has since grown to more than 150.,In a feeling of floodgates opening, the gymnasts were the latest in a growing chorus of complaints from athletes in bobsled and skeleton to rowing, rugby, synchronized swimming, women's soccer, among others. They're calling for a cleanup of the toxic culture in their sport, saying they've felt scared to speak out until now.,The Sports Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) won the contract last July to handle reports of maltreatment in sport, such as the complaints from gymnastics, bobsled and skeleton. St-Onge said it will be operational by late spring, and it will be mandatory for all federally-funded national sport organizations (NSOs) to work with the SDRCC.,Prior to last July, NSOs were required to have a safe sport officer, but there was grey area in some sports around whether they were truly a third party.,""I understand why athletes feel uncomfortable with that, because it can hardly be completely independent, if there's any kind of connection to the NSO,"" said Water Polo Canada's CEO Martin Goulet, who participated in Thursday's roundtable.,Goulet hopes the new safe sport mechanism will operate much like Canada's anti-doping program, through the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES).,""The model that we have for anti-doping is a great model, because it's completely independent, it's completely separate from us,"" Goulet said. ""As a CEO I cannot influence any of that, there's nothing I can do. Thank God it's like that."",The COC Athletes Commission urged St-Onge to accelerate the implementation of the SDRCC's independent mechanism.,St-Onge applauded the athletes for their courage in speaking out, saying ""it is because of their strength and courage that we're acting with an even greater sense of urgency."",She also commended the work done by her predecessors Steven Guilbeault and Kirsty Duncan. Duncan launched the Canadian Sports Help Line, a toll-free phone line for referrals, in 2019.,St-Onge said as of Friday, national-level athletes will have access to increased services offered by the SDRCC, and victims can access these services via the sport help line (1-888-83SPORT or ,).,""But we are all aware that work needs to be done on prevention, education, on changing the culture of sport in Canada, looking at the governance of the organizations, so there is going to be no stone unturned,"" St-Onge said. ""It's my priority. We're going to make sure that we change that culture of sport."",The crisis in culture is clear in sports such as gymnastics, which is made up mostly of athletes who are minors. And sports at the provincial and club level don't fall under the national sport organization umbrella.,""For sport to be sustainable, we need parents to feel that their children are well taken care of when they send them into clubs or the higher level. They need to know that there is a system in place to protect them and make sure that they can grow into beautiful adults. Right now, this crisis is shaking that confidence and that trust.,""Everybody who was at the roundtable today wants to make sure that kids and parents feel safe in the sport system. So, we need to do more."",The roundtable in Ottawa was either attended in-person or virtually by Erin Wilson, the president of AthletesCan; Paralympic athlete representative Tony Walby; Olympic athlete rep and two-time Olympic champion Rosie MacLennan; Canadian Olympic Committee CEO David Shoemaker and chief sport officer Eric Myles; Canadian Paralympic Committee CEO Karen O'Neill; Own the Podium CEO Anne Merklinger; Debra Gassewitz, president and CEO of the Sport Information Resource Centre; Coaching Association of Canada's CEO Lorraine Lafreniere; and Marie-Claude Asselin, the CEO and executive director of the SDRCC.,Goulet and Jasmine Northcott, the CEO of Water Ski & Wakeboard Canada, represented summer national sport organizations, while winter sports were represented by Skate Canada's CEO Debra Armstrong and Curling Canada CEO Katherine Henderson."
Elon Musk says he has $46.5B in financing ready to buy Twitter,"Elon Musk says he has lined up $46.5 billion US in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company's board to negotiate a deal.,Last week, Musk announced an , for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion US. At the time, he did not say how he would finance the acquisition.,The Tesla CEO said Thursday in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that he's exploring what's known as a tender offer to buy all of the social media platform's common stock for $54.20 per share in cash. Under a tender offer, Musk, who owns about nine per cent of Twitter shares, would take his offer directly to other shareholders, bypassing the board.,But Musk hasn't decided yet whether to do that.,Twitter said in a statement Thursday that it has received Musk's updated proposal. The company said its board is ""committed to conducting a careful, comprehensive and deliberate review to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders."",Last week, Twitter's board adopted a , that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. If someone acquires a 15 per cent stake in the company, it would trigger a huge payout to shareholders that could bankrupt the company.,Musk's financing would come from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions. Other banks involved include Barclays, Bank of America, Societie Generale, Mizuho Bank, BNP Paribas and MUFG. Morgan Stanley is one of Twitter's biggest shareholders, behind Vanguard Group and Musk.,Musk's documents say that $13 billion US in financing came from Morgan Stanley and the other banks, as much as $12.5 billion would be loans secured by his Tesla stock, and committed $21 billion US in equity, ""directly or indirectly"" from him, although he didn't say what the source of those funds would be. The filing says that the equity commitment could be reduced by contributions from others or additional debt taken on.,Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock — he owns about 17 per cent of the company, according to FactSet — which is valued at more than $1 trillion — and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It's unclear how much cash Musk has.,Electric car and solar panel maker Tesla allows executive officers to use shares as collateral for loans, but limits the borrowing to 25 per cent of the value of the pledged shares. Musk owns 172.6 million shares worth $176.47 billion. Just over 51 per cent of his stake already is pledged as collateral, according to a Tesla proxy statement. That means Musk could use the remaining stake to borrow about $21.5 billion.,Musk's latest move shows him ""ratcheting up the seriousness of purpose"" by lining up prominent banks that could finance his bid, said Donna Hitscherich, a finance professor at Columbia University.,""These are the usual suspects if you'd get financing,"" she said. ""But certainly it's pointing to the direction that he could make good on his thoughts were he to proceed in launching the tender offer."",Shares of Twitter rose slightly to $46.95 in Thursday afternoon trading, after the financing became public. The share price is $7.25, or 13 per cent below Musk's offer.,Musk ""is seeking to negotiate a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Twitter … and is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately,"" the documents say.,With a tender offer, Musk would try to get other shareholders to pledge their stock to him at a certain price on a certain date. If enough shareholders agree, Musk could use that as leverage to get the board to drop the poison pill defence.,Musk signaled the possibility of a tender offer several times this week in tweets using the word ""tender."""
"Political rhetoric on inflation is out of touch with reality, experts say","Prices in Canada are rising — and they're rising fast.,Statistics Canada released its measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ,. It reported that prices are now 6.7 per cent higher than they were this time last year.,It's the largest spike in the CPI since January of 1991, the year the government introduced the GST.,""Prices increased against the backdrop of sustained price pressure in Canadian housing markets, substantial supply constraints and geopolitical conflict, which has affected energy, commodity and agriculture markets,"" StatsCan said.,The Bank of Canada has ,, citing the need to curb inflation. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem ,.,The rising cost of living has caught the attention of many prominent politicians. But is what they're saying about it all true?,Conservative leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre, a former finance critic who is widely considered to be the front-runner in the race, has made inflation a central part of his campaign.,Poilievre claims the Trudeau government's approach to spending and taxation is a major force driving inflation.,""Trudeau's big spending, deficits and taxes have driven up inflation, which in turn is now driving up interest rates,"" ,.,""I would reverse JustinFlation with common sense policy, including: axing the carbon tax, phasing out inflationary deficits by ending wasteful spending and cancelling new promises and removing the gatekeepers to make more of what cash buys — energy, food and housing."",Is Poilievre right? Is government fiscal policy driving up prices?,Jean-Paul Lam, an economics professor at the University of Waterloo and a former assistant chief economist at the Bank of Canada, said government spending is one of many factors pushing prices up — but it's a relatively modest one.,Economic support programs related to the pandemic are a significant reason the federal deficit is so large now; the deficit was projected at $53 billion in the latest budget. But that doesn't come close to explaining the rate of inflation we're seeing now, he added.,""This is a minor factor ... I don't think the fiscal position of the government, although it has deteriorated significantly over the last two years, is a key factor to inflation right now,"" he said.,Trevor Tombe, a professor of economics at the University of Calgary and a research fellow at the university's School of Public Policy, said Poilievre is correct in the sense that government spending and taxation can be a factor in inflation.,""Fiscal policy can indeed matter for price levels if central banks don't respond to that spending,"" he said.,But the federal government's decisions on spending and taxation don't have much of a relationship to the other, more important forces pushing prices up, he said.,""It really doesn't matter what Canada's government spends. Oil prices are going to rise and fall due to much larger global forces that are beyond our control,"" he said.,""And even real estate prices being as high as they are, this is not a uniquely Canadian phenomenon. And we're seeing home costs rising by roughly the same amount throughout the developed world that we're seeing here in Canada."",NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh took to Instagram Wednesday to talk about the rising cost of living.,He argued that inflation is being driven not by supply issues, nor by government stimulus programs, but by big companies looking to boost profits.,""It's because of greed,"" Singh said. ""When the cost of things goes up, it hurts some people, but it benefits those at the very top."",There's some truth to the picture Singh paints, Lam said.,The pandemic has wiped out many smaller businesses, which means some bigger firms are facing less competition now. Businesses often raise prices when this happens, he said.,Some businesses also have faced increasing costs for raw materials and supplies, he said, and have passed those costs onto customers by raising prices.,But that doesn't mean Singh's reasoning is sound, he added.,""I think it's a bit too simplistic in terms of [an] explanation of inflation,"" Lam said. Pricing decisions being made by corporations now are largely responses to inflationary pressures coming from other factors, such as global supply constraints, he said.,Tombe agreed.,""This is, again, an example of political language oversimplifying complex issues like inflation,"" he said.,Tombe points to the auto industry, where a severe shortage of car parts has gutted supply and pushed up prices — but not necessarily profits.,""And so there's a lot of factors here that have nothing to do with greed, with market power, with corporate profits,"" Tombe said.,Lam and Tombe both said, however, that Singh has put his finger on an important point: inflation doesn't affect everyone the same way.,The well-off don't necessarily benefit from inflation — prices are rising for everyone, after all, including the rich — but the poor have a harder time dealing with more expensive essential goods. The price of groceries, for example, has increased 8.7 per cent compared to last year, according to the CPI.,And those with certain types of assets may benefit from inflation if the value of what they own goes up. Real estate is a good example of this, Lam said.,The bad news for people in financially precarious positions may not end with rising prices, Lam said.,Canada's central bank is likely to continue raising interest rates to address inflation, he said. That means debt loads will be more expensive to service.,""So you can see that the young people who've just got in the housing market, the people who have a lot of debt and coping with high mortgage debt, they are the one who are going to be hurt disproportionately compared to the people who have a massive amount of wealth,"" Lam said.,The Bank of Canada has also been in Poilievre's crosshairs. He has criticized its approach to monetary policy and accused it of driving inflation.,Tombe said that while Canada's central bank hasn't always performed flawlessly, it would be unfair to expect perfection given the unprecedented disruptions the global economy has faced in recent years.,""While I think, in retrospect, central banks ought to have been tightening earlier, I don't think that means they made a mistake given what they knew at the time, and given what was reasonable and all of the uncertainties involved,"" he said.,Lam's assessment of the bank's response to inflation is less forgiving.,""I think they've been very slow to react to inflation,"" he said.,""Their main message was, 'Don't worry, it's transitory. It's going to go back to two per cent, etc.' They, I think, made a mistake by sticking to that message for too long."",If the federal government, big business and the central bank aren't the primary culprits, what is causing prices to spike?,The answer to that question may be frustrating for the government — and for those seeking to lead it, like Poilievre and Singh. This current wave of inflation is mostly the result of global supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions — things over which Canada has little influence.,The Russia-Ukraine war has affected energy and food prices. Supply chain issues — especially in China, thanks to pandemic restrictions — are major factors, Lam said.,Demand for goods and services is also higher right now than many analysts predicted it would be earlier in the pandemic, he added.,""I think the bad news for Canadians is probably [inflation] is going to go higher in the months to come,"" he said.,Lam said raising interest rates is the most effective way of bringing inflation down, but it will be a difficult balance for the Bank of Canada to strike.,Tombe agreed with Lam's assessment of Canada's vulnerability. As a small trading nation, he said, Canada is exposed to global supply and geopolitical shocks but has few tools to fight back.,The situation calls for a cautious approach, he added.,""We don't want to overreact to what are potentially temporary factors,"" he said.,""If energy prices don't continue to rise, if home prices don't continue to rise at the rapid pace that we've seen, then inflation should get back closer to what we consider normal later this year and early next."""
Southern chiefs plan $130M redevelopment of the Bay as symbol of reconciliation,"The Hudson's Bay Co., which facilitated the colonization of Western Canada 352 years ago, is about to transfer its former flagship department store in downtown Winnipeg to Indigenous ownership.,On Friday morning, the Bay will hand over its six-storey, 655,000-square-foot building at the corner of Portage Avenue and Memorial Boulevard to the Southern Chiefs' Organization, which represents 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota Nations in southern Manitoba. ,The SCO plans to spend $130 million in the coming years transforming the former Bay building into a mixed-use development called Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn, or ""it is visible."",Plans for the project include 300 affordable housing units for members of Southern First Nations, two restaurants, a public atrium, a rooftop garden, a museum and an art gallery.,One of the restaurants, on the main floor, will serve First Nations cuisine. The second will be a reboot of the Bay department store's Paddlewheel restaurant.,The project will also include office space for Indigenous entrepreneurs, a health centre, a childcare facility, a seniors centre, a new seat of government for the SCO and a memorial for residential school victims and survivors.,The SCO plans to transfer two beaver pelts and one elk hide to Richard Baker, the HBC's governor and executive chairman, as a symbolic payment for the building, which has been valued at $0 due to the cost associated with renovating the 96-year-old structure and maintaining its heritage elements.,""What we wanted to do is really to create an opportunity to create reconciliation, to create a real symbol of what the future holds for Indigenous people in this country,"" Grand Chief Jerry Daniels of the SCO said in an interview at the Bay on Thursday.,""This is the most iconic building, I think, in Winnipeg and probably all of Manitoba and we wanted to ensure that if we have the opportunity to acquire the building, that we would do everything we can to address the needs and to create as much opportunity for the Indigenous community and also for Winnipeg broadly."",Baker said in a statement it was important for his company to ensure The Bay is redeveloped sustainably and in a meaningful way.,""We believe [Southern Chiefs] is the right steward for this location, and can create a new community landmark that will help advance reconciliation,"" he said.,The downtown Bay opened in 1926 as one of the most important commercial structures in downtown Winnipeg at a time when the city's growth had already been stunted by the aftermath of the First World War, the inconclusive result of the Winnipeg General Strike and the reduction of railway subsidies that fuelled the city's initial growth.,The department store fell into decline in the 1990s, as downtown Winnipeg's retail sector lost its lustre, initially to shopping malls in suburban neighbourhoods and later to online retailers.,The Bay's operations were scaled back floor by floor until the building was shuttered in November 2020, when the second wave of COVID-19 hastened a closure initially planned for the following winter.,Officials with the city and province started working on a redevelopment plan soon after, with former premier Brian Pallister announcing $25 million in provincial funding in 2021.,Daniels said the Southern Chiefs' Organization entered into discussions 18 months ago. Daniels said he flew to New York to meet with The Bay's Baker in 2021.,The Grand Chief noted the symmetry in receiving the building from the Hudson's Bay Co., which was established in 1670 to facilitate the fur trade in what would eventually become western Canada.,The trade routes that extended from York Factory at Hudson Bay would open up Indigenous lands to European settlement, including the future site of Winnipeg at the Red River Colony.,""This is about reconciliation, economic reconciliation,"" Daniels said. ""It's about land back, getting the land back and also helping and supporting us in getting that land back and making sure that it's successful.,""So we have a commitment from HBC not only to transfer the building, but also to work with us as a partner and to support us in any way they can."",A source with the provincial government said the province will contribute $10 million to the project. The federal government is expected to commit cash of its own.,The City of Winnipeg is expected to contribute tax incentives. A source with the city said a proposal is expected to come before city council in June.,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Premier Heather Stefanson and Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman are slated to join Daniels and Baker for the transfer ceremony on Friday at 10 a.m."
CNN's streaming service shutting down a month after launch,"CNN's brand-new streaming service,  CNN+, is shutting down only a month after launch.,In a Thursday memo, incoming CNN chief executive Chris Licht said the service would shut down at the end of April. CNN+ launched when its parent was still part of AT&T. It combined with Discovery earlier this month in a new company, Warner Bros. Discovery,  under Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who had his own vision for CNN and its Warner siblings.,In his memo, Licht said consumers wanted ""simplicity and an all-in service"" rather than ""stand-alone offerings."" Discovery had previously suggested that it wanted to merge the new company's separate streaming services, which include Discovery+ and HBO Max, into a single app.,Licht said some CNN+ content will wind up on other company networks, and the streaming service's employees will get opportunities to apply for jobs elsewhere inside Warner Bros. Discovery.,The head of CNN+, Andrew Morse, is leaving the company.,""While today's decision is incredibly difficult, it is the right one for the long-term success of CNN. It allows us to refocus resources on the core products that drive our singular focus: further enhancing CNN's journalism and its reputation as a global news leader,"" Licht wrote.,CNN+ was never made available in Canada.,Under AT&T, there were $100 million in development costs and some 500 employees assigned to building out CNN+.,The service had attracted big names for its lineup, from former Fox anchor Chris Wallace to food-media star Alison Roman, as part of the company's effort to appeal to younger people with a streaming news service as cable news audiences age.,There had been skepticism that a paid news streaming service would attract interest from consumers, who already have available a slew of online TV. While Fox has a paid streaming service, Fox Nation, other major TV news organizations make their apps available free."
Why Elon Musk's free speech crusade for Twitter may stumble,"Elon Musk gaining control of Twitter and becoming a ""benevolent dictator"" who acts as protector of free speech would be a welcome development, says the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union.,Certainly, it's a ""deplorable situation"",that so much power rests on the personal predilections of a single individual, said Nadine Strossen, who led the ACLU from 1991 to 2008. Yet she said she would greatly favour a free speech advocate acquiring power over one of the social media companies.,""That would be wonderful."",The problem, however, is that Strossen remains skeptical whether Musk, the world's richest person, and self-described ""free speech absolutist"" would actually honour his commitment to the cause.,""As to whether it's likely that he is going to resist the enormous pressures to deviate from that pledge, I don't know him personally, but human nature throughout history and around the world suggests that it's extremely unlikely, if not impossible, that that's going to happen,"" she said.,Strossen is among a number of free speech advocates and social media analysts questioning whether Musk, if he gains control of Twitter, will make it the free speech forum he has advocated — or if he understands the challenges that he would face. ,Musk has been an outspoken critic of Twitter's policies, saying they are too restrictive when it comes to moderating content. Last week, he launched a $43-billion takeover bid for the social media platform.,""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said during a TED conference in Vancouver on April 14, following his takeover bid announcement.,""Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it's just really important that people have the, both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law."",Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. <br><br>What should be done? <a href=""https://t.co/aPS9ycji37"">https://t.co/aPS9ycji37</a>,Musk could have a positive influence on free speech with Twitter, said Scott Wilkens, who focuses on freedom of speech online and government regulation of social media platforms at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute.,Wilkens said he has been encouraged by Musk's comments that he wants to make public the algorithms that prioritize what one sees in their Twitter feed.,""I,think that kind of transparency is very healthy for free speech,"" Wilkens said.,But Wilkens also expressed concern over a single person controlling a company like Twitter — particularly someone with that much power. He also said he worried about what that private control might mean for free speech, as opposed to having a publicly traded company that is answerable to shareholders in charge.,""That's certainly a concern, because we just don't know what Elon Musk might do as far as free speech is concerned,"" he said.,Kevin Goldberg, a First Amendment specialist for the Freedom Forum, a Maryland-based free speech advocacy group, said part of the problem is that Musk is no ""First Amendment scholar."",He has acknowledged in various interviews that there are limits consistent with the First Amendment. So right there, that's moderation; it may be moderation to the broadest extent of the law, but then he becomes the one interpreting the law."",During his TED conference, Musk said in the case of a ""grey area"" involving a questionable or controversial tweet, ""I would say let the tweet exist,"" but ""perhaps you'd not want to necessarily promote that tweet."",He said he doesn't have all the answers, but that he wants to be ""very reluctant to delete things."",Musk, though, may not realize that the concept of unlocking Twitter and allowing all legal speech on the platform is ""really complicated,"" said Kate Klonick, a St. John's University assistant professor of law who focuses on law and technology and private platform governance of online speech.,Musk, for example, has said one of his top priorities would be to eliminate spam from Twitter.,But to allow all legal speech technically allowed under the First Amendment onto the platform, ""you would have to allow all spam to stay up on the platform,"" Klonick said in an interview with NPR. ""You would have to allow all pornography to stay up on the platform, all forms of hate speech,"" she said. ,""And so all of that would stay up, at least within the U.S., [and] it could make the platform functionally unusable."",Scott Nover, a tech reporter for Quartz magazine and author of the recent article "","" said throughout the history of major social media platforms, executives have stated that they wanted them to be free speech havens.,For example, Dick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter, once said that Twitter belongs ""to the free speech wing of the free speech party."",But eventually, those platforms enact rules limiting what can be posted on their forums. ,""Every social media platform, in order to grow its business, which is advertising, has tightened its restrictions on what people can and cannot say,"" Nover said.,Meanwhile some have pointed out that Musk himself hasn't always lived up to the ideals of free speech absolutism. Last year, Musk tried to get a, an account that tracked his private jet comings and goings. And a former employee of Tesla was, for posting a critical YouTube review of the company's full self-driving software.,""Elon Musk internally, within his own world, is not a huge champion of unfettered free speech,"" Nover said."
McDonald's still rejects customers' reusable mugs due to COVID-19 — unless they live in Vancouver,"Donna Patterson of Toronto said she was disappointed when she visited two local McDonald's restaurants in the past couple of months and was told she couldn't be served tea in her reusable mug.,""It doesn't make sense,"" said Patterson, who volunteers with a Toronto environmental group. ""I said to them, 'You're going to lose business from this, because I noticed there's a groundswell of people that want to be [using reusables] now.'"",McDonald's Canada has yet to adopt a permanent national policy allowing customers to be served coffee or tea in their reusable mugs, instead of disposable cups. ,The fast-food chain blames the delay on COVID-19 related health concerns. Even so,,, McDonald's has accepted customers' reusable mugs in Vancouver, following the implementation of a city bylaw mandating those buying coffee in disposable cups pay a 25-cent fee.,Some environmentalists say McDonald's continuing to reject customers' personal mugs in other locations is unacceptable as the planet faces numerous environmental threats. ,""McDonald's should absolutely be encouraging customers to bring their own cups to every store,"" said Karen,Wirsig, project manager for Environmental Defence.,""Why are they delaying this? This is such low-hanging fruit. 'Oh, you've got your own cup. I can pour stuff into it.' … I don't even understand any excuse."",Disposable coffee cups are problematic because they're lined with plastic, making them difficult to recycle. As a result, most of the cups — and their plastic lids — end up in landfills or as litter, strewn along roadsides and shorelines.,In fact, disposable cups and lids combined consistently make The Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup's, because its volunteers collect so many of them. ,""Coffee cups and lids have been found to be one of the most pervasive single-use plastic items found in our oceans and on our shorelines,"" said the environmental organization, Oceana Canada,,. ,Pre-pandemic, it was standard practice for coffee shops to accept reusable mugs. McDonald's, however, said it left the decision up to franchisees. Consequently, many locations rejected personal mugs,,. ,The decision to allow the use of reusable cups or tumblers is left to owner/operators to make. We're currently running a test around tumblers at our 2 Green Concept Restaurants &amp; McCafé locations. Afterward, we plan to roll out a national policy at all restaurants.,In response to an inquiry about the complaints, McDonald's told CBC News in January 2020 that it hoped to implement a national reusable mug policy by the end of the following month. ,""We listen to our guests, and we know this is an area of growing importance to Canadians,"" said spokesperson Ryma Boussoufa in an email.,This week, McDonald's told CBC News that it introduced its national reusable cup policy days before the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, but then was forced to suspend the policy due to fears it might help spread the virus,Other major coffee chains, such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons, also, when the pandemic hit, but both those chains have since reversed that policy.,Their decision, that reusable containers can be used safely during the pandemic — as long as businesses incorporate proper sanitary measures.,""We've been looking forward to accepting reusable cups in restaurants again and have been working hard with Tims restaurant owners to ensure we do so safely and consistently,"" said Paul Yang, Tim Hortons' senior director of innovation and sustainability,. ,The chain began welcoming back reusable mugs on April 6. ,McDonald's, meanwhile, has yet to resume its nascent national reusable mug policy outside of Vancouver.,""Reintroducing the reusable travel mug program nationally will be handled in a phased approach"" as ""part of our ongoing commitment to minimize our environmental footprint and protect the planet,"" a McDonald's spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CBC News. The company offered no specific dates or timeline. ,As a customer, Patterson suggests McDonald's had no choice but to accept reusable mugs in Vancouver because of the city's new bylaw, and said it's incomprehensible why the chain can't also accept the mugs in other regions. ,""If they can do it in Vancouver, they can do it everywhere,"" she said. ""Why would they do a phased approach?"",McDonald's did not respond to questions about why only Vancouver locations are currently accepting personal mugs. ,Wirsig said that to encourage people to embrace reusables, coffee shops should not only accept personal mugs but also incorporate exchange programs where customers buy a store's mug and then exchange it for a clean one — free of charge — each time they order a take-out beverage. ,""That's really one of the answers,"" the environmentalist said. ""This really would be easy for them to set up systems and I think people would appreciate it."",A&W is currently piloting a , at more than two dozen locations in Vancouver. Tim Hortons said it's planning to soon launch a similar trial at select Vancouver locations.,Last year, McDonald's, — in the United Kingdom. ,But in Canada, many McDonald's customers are still waiting to be served coffee in their own reusable mugs.,""Get on with it,"" said Wirsig."
"As inflation ticks ever higher, Macklem won't rule out super-sized rate hike","With inflation showing no signs of abating despite hitting its highest level in more than 30 years, the head of the Bank of Canada opened the door to bigger and faster rate hikes to try to rein in the runaway increase in the cost of living.,Speaking from Washington, D.C., on Thursday, where he was attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group as well as meetings of G7 and G20 central bank governors and finance ministers, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem didn't rule out increasing the central bank's benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points or more at its next policy meeting in June.,Like most central banks around the world, the Bank of Canada slashed its interest rate when the pandemic started in March 2020 in an attempt to assuage fears and make sure borrowing was as affordable as possible to encourage investment. Typically, central banks lower their interest rate to encourage borrowing and investing to stimulate a sluggish economy, and they raise rates to cool things down amid high inflation.,Two years after slashing borrowing costs to as low as they've ever been, those record-low rates have been accused of contributing to inflation, which has risen to its highest level in decades. In March, the ,, 25 basis points or a quarter of a per cent, to signal the era of cheap lending was coming to an end.,Central banks prefer to move cautiously in any direction, moving rates in 0.25-percentage-point increments when possible, so it was noteworthy when the bank followed that small hike with , this month. That moved the bank's rate to one per cent, still well below where the rate was before the pandemic, but it was the first time in more than 20 years that the bank hiked by that much in one fell swoop.,With Canada's inflation rate at an ,, investors in financial instruments known as swaps suggest another big hike of half a percentage point at the bank's next meeting in June is all but certain. And there's even a decent chance of an even bigger one of 75 basis points or more.,""It could certainly happen,"" Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter told CBC News in an interview Friday. He noted that the next planned rate decision in early June is more than a month away, and the bank will have a slew of important data points between now and then, including another inflation number for April.,""Why not consider ... very unusual possibilities? Because we are in a fairly exceptional circumstance here,"" Porter said.,Macklem did little to douse those speculative flames in his comments. Although CBC was not able to attend his virtual remarks and there was no transcript, Scotiabank economist Derek Holt quoted Macklem as saying he was ""not going to rule anything out"" in terms of the size of any rate hike. ""We're prepared to be as forceful as needed and I'm really going to let those words speak for themselves,"" Macklem reportedly said.,Macklem also said ongoing supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine and spike in COVID-19 cases in China will likely make high inflation linger for longer than anticipated. Earlier this month, the bank said it doesn't expect inflation to get back into the range of between one and three per cent that it targets until the latter half of next year.,""He also reiterated how a pause would only be entertained once the policy rate was in the neutral rate range,"" Holt said, referring to the level where interest rates reach a Goldilocks level where they are neither stimulating the economy, nor holding it back. Most economists think that so called ""neutral range"" is a bank rate of somewhere between two and three per cent, well above its current level.,""There remains somewhat of an inconsistency between saying they are not on autopilot while also saying they won't pause until they get into a neutral range,"" Holt said.,Canada isn't the only country mulling faster and bigger rate hikes. Earlier Thursday, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that a 50 basis point interest rate hike is possible in May, after one Fed member had suggested a 75 basis point jump can't be ruled out as inflation there is ,, it's highest level since 1982.,It wouldn't be the first time the U.S. Federal Reserve has moved by 75 points in living memory, since they did so more than once starting in 1995. ,""It's not out of the realm of memory for some of us,""  Porter said. ""So I wouldn't say it's that extremely unusual if they chose to go by three quarters of a percentage point."""
Quebec invests $11M in making alpine resorts year-round attractions,"With climate change shortening the winter season and melting away the ski industry's profit margins, the Quebec government is earmarking $11 million to transform alpine resorts into year-round businesses.,Caroline Proulx, the province's tourism minister, said the idea is to ""really to develop our mountains in Quebec."",Proulx said Quebec's mountains can also be used for mountain biking, zip lining, hiking and camping. ,She said there can be observation posts to check out the views and other activities that take advantage of the landscape. There could be tours of the local area and foods, or cultural events at the foot of the mountain, she said.,Quebec is inviting nine regions known for their mountains to submit a four-season plan to diversify their offering to tourists.,""We always talk about seasonality in Quebec. We have two big poles: winter and summer. Now, we have to make sure to develop over four seasons,"" she said.,Investing in the mountains, she explained, will help bring more money to the regions surrounding the alpine resorts.,The head of Tourisme Charlevoix, Mitchell Dion, said the plan will help with staffing shortages.,""It's always easier to recruit when we offer jobs that are four seasons,"" Dion said. ""It's also better for the economy, for the local communities."",Dion said his region has already started working on attractions for summer, spring and fall.,""If we could manage to raise occupancy rates and attendance in tourism businesses a little, we could really have a higher quality of employment,"" Dion said,,The marketing director for Mount Sutton in the Eastern Townships said the extra money from the government will help alpine resorts and tourism pick up again after more than two years of pandemic.,""Over the last three years, we've implemented, with some partners, mountain biking,"" said Nadya Baron. ,""We also have a new zip line. We have camping and we do the chairlift rides seven days on seven all summer long."""

'An act of erasure': LCBO called out for sticker covering the word 'Palestine' on wine bottle,"Samer Abdelnour was visiting his family in Toronto when he decided to take out a bottle of wine he had ordered online and had delivered to them as a gift.,When he grabbed the bottle, he noticed a plain white sticker placed on top of the front label. Confused, he peeled it back to find the words ""of Palestine"" written underneath.,The 2019 bottle of red wine, ordered for home delivery via the website of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), was produced by Taybeh Winery, which is located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank village of Taybeh, north of Jerusalem. ,Abdelnour is a Palestinian Canadian, though he has lived in Europe for nearly 12 years. He works as an associate professor at the University of Edinburgh Business School. He also co-founded Al-Shabaka, a leading Palestinian think-tank.,Abdelnour had placed the online order on March 16, ahead of a planned visit to Canada in April.,When his family received the order, they unboxed the beer and wine and set them aside. This past Sunday, he said, they decided to take the wine out to have with dinner, when he spotted the label.,""That's when I thought, 'OK, what's this covering up?'"" Abdelnour said. ""I peeled it off and saw the 'of Palestine' underneath."",Abdelnour said seeing the word ""Palestine"" covered up on the bottle was ""upsetting"" and he took to Twitter to ask the LCBO why the sticker was placed there.,""As a Canadian, as a Palestinian, as a consumer, I mean, this is just — it's ridiculous, it's offensive and probably illegal,"" he said, noting it was the first time he had ordered Taybeh wine through the LCBO.,""It really reflects a deep settler-colonial insecurity when even mentioning Palestine is deemed a threat."",Dear ⁦<a href=""https://twitter.com/LCBO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@LCBO</a>⁩ — can you please explain this incredibly offensive sticker covering “of Palestine” on the bottle of <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Taybeh?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Taybeh</a> wine I ordered? <a href=""https://t.co/a5eW1o4d5C"">pic.twitter.com/a5eW1o4d5C</a>,The LCBO said labelling on its products complies with the provincial and federal laws and guidelines outlined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which enforces food-labelling requirements in Canada.,According to the LCBO, Taybeh wines produced since 2020 and sold at LCBO are labelled as originating from the ""West Bank."" However, bottles produced prior to 2020 used a sticker as an ""interim solution,"" the LCBO said. ,""Suppliers are required to meet the labelling requirements for packaged food and beverage alcohol products sold in Canada as set out by the CFIA,"" an LCBO spokesperson said.,""In some cases, when labels do not meet regulatory requirements, suppliers are given the opportunity to modify labels to meet requirements."",In this particular case, the Crown corporation said, the labels were revised to comply with the CFIA requirements, but didn't say whether it was the LCBO, Taybeh or the supplier that placed the sticker.,According to Palestine Just Trade, the organization which serves as Taybeh's agent in Canada, the wine was first purchased by the LCBO in March 2019 and ""Product of Palestine"" labels were approved at that time. However, the LCBO put the release on hold and later asked that stickers saying ""West Bank"" be placed on the products.,""The LCBO has continued to require West Bank on the label. The LCBO asked with the most recent shipment that also a blank sticker be placed over the word Palestine in the product title, 'Taybeh of Palestine,'"" it said in an email.,In a statement to CBC News, the CFIA said it is the responsibility of regulated parties to comply with Canada's food-labelling requirements.,When asked what it was about the label that didn't meet the requirements, the CFIA said that information provided on a label ""must not be false or misleading."",While Canada had previously , an independent Palestinian state, in recent years, the federal government , in support of Palestinians' right to self-determination, including embracing a two-state solution as part of a ""comprehensive peace settlement"" in the Middle East.,​""​When assessing a product's compliance, CFIA reviews all information on food labels — including words, images, vignettes and logos — as they will contribute to the overall impression created by that product to determine whether the label is false or a consumer could be misled,"" the CFIA statement said.,​The agency added that when a labelling violation is identified, the CFIA requests that the ""necessary corrections"" be made by the appropriate regulated party. The CFIA did not say what the violation was in this case.,The CFIA previously came under fire when it ruled that two wines made by Israeli settlement wineries located in the West Bank, Psagot Winery and Shiloh Winery, could be sold in Canada with the label ""Product of Israel"" under the terms of the Canadian-Israel Free Trade Agreement. ,David Kattenburg, of Winnipeg, ,, claiming the federal food inspection agency did not follow Canadian and international law in making its decision. Two years later, a Federal Court judge found that , as a ""Product of Israel"" is misleading and deceptive, putting the requirement on the CFIA to decide how the wines should be labelled.,Kattenburg told CBC News the government had appealed that ruling, and in May of 2021 the Federal Court of Appeal rejected the government's appeal, sending the labelling issue back to the CFIA for ""redetermination."",""CFIA regulations require that wine labelling be 'regionally consistent.' If a Palestinian wine product produced in the West Bank needs to be labelled 'West Bank,' rather than 'Palestine,' then so does an Israeli settlement wine produced in the West Bank,"" Kattenburg said.,""Coming up with a truthful, accurate, non-misleading label isn't rocket science. We anticipate the CFIA will do so."",As for Abdelnour, he said he had yet to receive a response from the LCBO following his tweet. But he said incidents like this make it hard to talk about his family's homeland.,""You don't see that in other parts of the world. I've been living outside of Canada for a good part of a dozen years in Europe,"" he said. ""And in some places, you just see a lot of aggression and hostility, but, you know, people talk about Palestine in a way that I think it's sometimes difficult to do in Toronto or in Canada."",Abdelnour said the incident isn't the first time he has experienced an ""act of erasure"" as a Palestinian.,""It's tiring. I feel like growing up in Toronto, the narrative has been so hostile against Palestinians,"" Abdelnour said. ""It's just tiring to face this sort of constant aggressiveness and denial. It really is an act of erasure."",CBC News has also reached out to Taybeh Winery but did not receive a response in time for publication."
Netflix's dip in subscribers signals the hurdles ahead for streamers,"Streaming services that revolutionized how people consume entertainment are now facing a host of challenges when it comes to growing — or even sustaining — their subscriber base.,On Tuesday, Netflix's first-quarter earnings showed the streaming service , — its first decline since 2011. The results rattled investors, and Netflix's stock took a 37 per cent plunge by Thursday morning.,The market was expecting weak performance in this last quarter, but the extent of the drop came as a ""total shock,"" said senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan.,""It raises questions about the ultimate endgame for Netflix, of course, and for all streamers,"" she said.,Ranganathan pointed to a host of factors playing into Netflix's troubles, including after-effects of the pandemic, inflation and the Ukraine war. The company lost 700,000 subscribers after suspending its services in Russia last month.,However, Netflix's domination of the streaming industry has been under threat for some time, with the rise of other streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and HBO Max, or Crave in Canada.  ,""Netflix in the past has just kind of downplayed it,' said Ranganathan.,In a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings acknowledged the success of the platform's competitors and the impact they're having on Netflix's performance. ,""We have great competition. They've got some very good shows and films out. And what we've got to do is take it up a notch,"" he said.,AT&T's first-quarter earnings, released Thursday, showed HBO and HBO Max added three million subscribers so far in 2022, hitting nearly 77 million subscribers worldwide.,While Netflix is grabbing headlines for losing subscribers, that bad news is partly a function of the streaming giant being the front-runner in the industry, with around 222 million subscribers worldwide. ,""You have all the other streamers that are kind of still trying to play catch up to Netflix,"" said Ranganathan. ""Down the road, they're probably going to be running into these exact same problems."",The expectation from investors that Netflix would grow quarter after quarter was unrealistic, says Jon Giegengack, the founder of Entertainment Hub Research, a U.S.-based consumer research company.  ,""The slowing or the stagnation of their growth is something that I think was inevitable because they had the market to themselves for so long, and now, after quite a long time, are starting to face some real significant competitors,"" he said. ,Meanwhile, as inflation reaches a 31-year high in Canada (and a 40-year high south of the border), many are having to consider where they can start trimming their budgets. ,For Christine MacDonald-Stirrat, of London, Ont., one of those areas has been subscriptions to streaming services. The 27-year-old says she recently cancelled her Crave account because she didn't feel she was getting her money's worth with the content available. ,""For a while it was like, 'Oh, whatever. I don't care,'"" said MacDonald-Stirrat. ""But now when groceries are going up and gas is going up and rent is astronomical, it's like, OK, I have to cancel, because now that does make a difference."",According to a , conducted earlier this year by Angus Reid in partnership with CBC News, 53 per cent of Canadians are cutting down on discretionary spending. The survey was conducted between Feb. 11 and 13 with 1,622 Canadians and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20. ,Inflation is playing into Netflix's challenges when it comes to holding onto subscribers, said Ranganathan. ""There's only so much that consumers can afford to pay for all of these different streaming services."",Streaming services actually struggle with higher rates of ""churn"" than cable providers, said Giegengack, because they don't require contracts to sign up.,A recent , released by Deloitte on digital media trends found generation Z and millennial consumers are especially likely to cancel subscriptions to video-streaming services. ,""Streaming platforms are already aware of the importance of keeping people engaged once they sign up,"" said Giegengack. ,As Netflix hits a ceiling with its customer base, the streaming giant is looking at other ways to bring in revenue. ,It's now considering tiered subscriptions that would provide a cheaper alternative to current plans, with advertising integrated into the watching experience. ,""Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" said Hastings in Wednesday's conference call. ""But as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice."" ,Netflix wouldn't be the only streaming service to include advertising in their content. Disney Plus announced last month its intention to introduce a subscription tier with advertising in the U.S. ,Offering both options can help the company reach a larger consumer base, said Giegengack. His company's research has found that more than half of people are willing to watch ads if it means saving $4 or $5.,""Not all consumers have tolerance for ads, but a surprising number of them do,"" he said.,Netflix is also hoping to address password sharing, estimating in their letter to shareholders that some 100 million households currently share their passwords with other households. Last month, the company launched a pilot project in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica where customers can pay a fee to share their password. ,""We've always tried to make sharing ,a member's household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they've created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households,"" the letter read. ,Based on current trends, Netflix is further forecasting it will lose an additional two million subscribers in the second quarter of this year, leading to some concern about the streamer's future. ,While Netflix has been a ""pioneer"" when it comes to its content, Ranganathan said its earning results raise questions about whether that content is resonating, despite the billions being poured into it.,""They really have to kind of take a look at their model and see how to create more content without spending as much — but really create content that keeps viewers engaged,"" said Ranganathan. ,Despite these recent results, Giegengack says he doesn't believe the future is all grim for streaming, particularly as people today are more likely to have multiple subscriptions than they were a few years ago. ,One way Giegengack says the industry may change is through the bundling of services, where streamers with complementary content or services will start offering packaged subscriptions to consumers. ,""Consumers increasingly see value in aggregators that kind of combine this stuff for them,"" he said. ,This type of bundling has already started to happen, with telecom companies like Rogers offering Disney Plus with their TV services. ,And while streamers may have to find new ways to turn profit and improve retention of consumers, both Ranganathan and Giegengack agree Netflix's challenges today in no way signify the end of streaming. ,""I don't think it's the end of Netflix or the end of streaming,"" said Ranganathan. ""It's definitely a recalibration of expectations."""
