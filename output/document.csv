3,"Housing market slowdown continues, with average selling price down 13% since February","Canada's housing market continued to cool down from its red-hot pandemic pace in May, with the average price of a Canadian home that sold during the month going for $711,000, a decline of more than $100,000 in the past three months.While May is typically a strong month for home sales, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) said Wednesday that the volume of homes that sold fell precipitously during the month, down by 20 per cent compared with the same period a year ago.The slowdown means that home sales are now finally back to the level they were at before the COVID-19 pandemic, the realtor group said.After cooling down in March and April 2020 as the pandemic was unfolding, Canada's housing market has rebounded strongly, with selling prices and sales volumes setting record high after record high for much of the past two years.But that momentum has shifted noticeably in recent months, as lending rates that were slashed early in the pandemic start to rise, making mortgages more expensive and reducing buyers' purchasing power.CREA says the average price of a home that sold on its Multiple Listing Service last month went for $711,000. That's down by more than 13 per cent from the all-time high of $816,720 set back in February 2022.""Ultimately this has been expected and forecast for some time — a slowdown to more normal levels of sales activity and a flattening out of prices,"" CREA's chief economist, Shaun Cathcart, said in a news release.Typical mortgage payment could be 30% higher in 5 years, Bank of Canada warnsCREA says the average price figure can be misleading because it is easily skewed by sales in large expensive markets such as Toronto and Vancouver. So it calculates another number, known as the House Price Index (HPI), which it says is a better gauge of the market because it adjusts for the volume and types of housing.The HPI edged down by 0.8 per cent in the month, CREA says, following a 1.1 per cent decrease in April. But it is still more than 19 per cent higher than it was last year, mostly because of the eye-popping gains seen in late 2021.The same can be said of the average price figure, which is still 3.4 per cent higher than it was a year ago, despite three monthly declines in a row.Different trends across the countryIf Toronto and Vancouver are stripped out of the numbers, the average price of a Canadian home that sold in May was $588,500.The biggest factor driving the national number lower is Ontario, where most markets are seeing significant price declines. Rishi Sondhi, an economist with TD Bank, said there's an interesting regional story playing out beneath the picture of the national market.""Sales and prices are down disproportionately in Ontario and British Columbia, which suffered severe affordability deterioration during the pandemic,"" he said, noting that the numbers in the Greater Toronto Area look especially bleak — and that's the part of the country that saw the biggest run-up in prices earlier due largely to investors piling into a rising market.AnalysisNewest homebuyers could pay the price for Canada's financial stability""It's also likely the case that some GTA buyers purchased their homes before selling their old ones [thinking the market would remain hot] and are now being forced to accept lower prices to complete their transactions. We would, however, expect this dynamic to run its course in relatively short order,"" Sondhi said.Suburbs hit hardestCailey Heaps, president and CEO of Toronto-based real estate firm Heaps Estrin, says the slowdown in Toronto is mostly happening in the suburbs, where prices jumped the most during the pandemic as buyers sought more space. Now, the market is regressing to the mean.""Real estate markets have not been performing normally for a few years now, so any change is going to feel like a massive change, but it is really just a shift to a more balanced market,"" she said in an interview.The house price index for the Greater Toronto Area has fallen by 2.5 per cent in the past three months, but is still up by 24 per cent compared to where it was a year ago, and up by 62 per cent compared to where it was three years ago, before the pandemic, CREA says.While Heaps expects higher mortgage rates to drag down prices for the rest of the year and cause pain for owners who paid a premium when things were hot, ultimately she thinks the market will remain strong due to lack of supply and the ongoing influx of immigrants looking for housing.""People who are going to be disposing of properties now are people who didn't forecast the change in interest rates and they just can't carry their properties,"" she said.Wesley Favro owned a condo in Kelowna, B.C., up until 2020, when he and his partner sold it, hoping to move up to something bigger. But prices quickly escalated beyond their budget, so they're now renting and waiting for an opportunity to buy. (Tom Popyk/CBC)Another market that saw red hot gains earlier in the pandemic that are winding down now is B.C., where prices outside Victoria and Vancouver are cooling. That could be good news for prospective buyers like Wesley Favro, who had a condo in Kelowna until 2020, when he and his partner sold it, hoping to move up into something larger. But that's when prices took off in B.C.'s Interior, leaving the couple behind — despite having two good incomes.""It feels like we can't really get ahead and that we're sort of just spinning our wheels in the current environment,"" Favro told CBC News in an interview. He says they've looked at numerous properties in the past two years, but every time they contemplated putting in an offer, the home would sell in a bidding war with more than a dozen buyers.Nearly 1 in 4 homeowners say they'd have to sell home if interest rates rise more, according to survey""There was nothing really that we could afford within our price range that was also going to be a good fit for our lifestyle,"" Favro said, adding that he hopes the market may slow down enough for him to put down the roots they want in the community they love.""It seems like we missed the mark and, honestly, we'd really like to stay here. We love the community ... but it feels like we can't stay."""
4,Travelling this summer? Here's what you need to know as vaccine mandates lift,"This story idea came from audience members, like you, who got in touch with us. Send us your questions about travel. We are listening: ask@cbc.caAs COVID-19 restrictions gradually ease, many Canadians are planning to travel this summer. Here's what you need to know if you're planning a trip.What are the latest changes? Effective June 20, passengers no longer need to be fully vaccinated — with two doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine or one of Johnson & Johnson's — to board a plane or train in Canada. The federal government is also lifting vaccination requirements for federally regulated workers, allowing airline and airport employees on unpaid leave because of their vaccination status to return to work.Ottawa will bring back the mandates if the COVID-19 situation changes for the worse, according to Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc.Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist, has said it's the ""right time"" to end the travel mandates, because they no longer serve their intended purpose of preventing COVID-19 transmission on transportation.WATCH | It's time to drop travel mandates, says specialist: 'Right time' to end vaccine travel mandates, says specialist1 day agoDuration 2:04It's reasonable for Ottawa to drop the COVID-19 vaccine mandates for travel, says infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Isaac Bogoch, noting two doses doesn't prevent Omicron transmission.What stays the same?Vaccinated Canadians returning from abroad must still meet entry requirements, including using the ArriveCAN mobile app or desktop version to submit their travel- and COVID-19-related information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada.The unvaccinated must still meet additional testing and quarantine requirements or face a fine up to $5,000 or criminal prosecution.Feds temporarily suspend random arrival testing at Canada's airportsOutbound travellers must continue to abide by other countries' entry rules, which for many countries, including the United States, includes proof of vaccination.Masks remain mandatory for those boarding planes or trains.Vaccine mandates for cruise ship passengers and crews remain in place. Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said the decision was based on ""the unique nature of cruise ship travel,"" which includes passengers being in close contact with each other for an extended period of time.Will this fix the airport delays? Some industry groups and politicians have blamed the recent chaos at some Canadian airports on COVID-related border restrictions, while government officials say the delayed or cancelled flights and hours-long security lineups are because of staffing shortages.LeBlanc has said lifting the vaccine mandates won't immediately affect airport delays.However, he and Alghabra have said the government has taken steps to address the problems, including hiring more security screening personnel and adding more customs kiosks.What about monkeypox? Health officials are encouraging Canadians to take extra precautions, because of the potential threat of monkeypox, if travelling to 31 countries, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Mexico, Spain and Germany. The ""level two"" notice, issued on June 7 by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), is one step below a recommendation to avoid non-essential travel.It's rare to see outbreaks of the virus outside of West and Central Africa, but cases have cropped up around the world in recent weeks. At least 123 have been confirmed in Canada.PHAC says anyone with symptoms or a diagnosis of monkeypox should delay their travel and isolate. The virus is known for causing telltale skin lesions, but often initially shows up as a flu-like illness.The agency says travellers may be subject to isolation or other measures to limit the spread of the virus upon arrival at their destination. It also cautions that those who go abroad could have limited access to appropriate care if they become ill and could face delays returning home.How do I protect myself? Many precautions against COVID-19 are also effective against monkeypox, says respirologist Dr. Samir Gupta, though the latter spreads more via direct contact than through the air.""You really want to focus on preventing contact, washing hands — even wearing gloves,"" he told CBC News.Still, wearing a mask is a good idea as some studies have suggested the virus is capable of spreading through the air, he said.PHAC recommends that travellers consult a health-care professional or visit a travel health clinic at least six weeks before their trip. It also says travellers can lower their risk by being ""particularly vigilant"" at any large parties or gatherings.WATCH | Precautions against monkeypox: A doctor's tips to avoid monkeypox while travelling8 days agoDuration 3:57Washing your hands and wearing a mask are good precautions for travellers trying to avoid monkeypox, says respirologist Dr. Samir Gupta.When will my passport be renewed?Long lineups have become common outside passport offices from B.C. to Montreal, because of what Service Canada called an ""unprecedented surge"" in applications as travel reopens after two years of pandemic restrictions.Some people have had to reschedule trips because of the bottleneck.Service Canada has said it's brought on 600 new employees to help.All passport service counters were reopened last month, and others have been added at more than 300 centres.Based on projections from early June, 75 per cent of applicants should receive their passport within 40 working days, according to a spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada. Ninety-six per cent of those who submit an application in person at a specialized site should receive theirs within 10 working days.From left, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra and Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos announce the changes in Ottawa.

Fox, as money poured into the tech sector during the health crisis.Wealthsimple valued at $5B after fresh round of investor cash, including from Canadian celebs""Of course volatility works both ways, and we're seeing the other side of it now as the pandemic market conditions unwind,"" Katchen wrote to workers.""Many of our clients are living through a period of market uncertainty they've never experienced before.""The changing conditions mean the company will now focus more heavily on core businesses, like investing and banking, and products he believes will power financial innovation, like those within the crypto industry.Wealthsimple will reduce its investment in other areas like peer-to-peer payments, tax, and merchant services and restructuring teams dedicated to recruiting, marketing, client success and research, Katchen added.""Today is going to be hard — there's no getting around it,"" he said, in his note. ""But our mission has never been more important.""Wealthsimple's job cuts come as global technology companies are bracing for a market correction and possible recession as the exuberance around tech stocks is fading and some share prices have plummeted 50 per cent from their COVID-19 highs.Netflix, Klarna, Cameo and Bolt are among those that have already conducted layoffs, though many others are freezing hiring.Technology incubators including the DMZ in Toronto and Communitech in Waterloo, Ont. are advising startups to bolster their cash reserves, prepare for fewer investments from venture capitalists and focus on revenue-generating segments of their businesses.Wealthsimple was founded in 2014 by Katchen and is primarily owned by Power Corp."

9,"MLS, Apple announce 10-year streaming partnership","Apple's foray into live sports took a big step forward Tuesday.Apple and Major League Soccer have announced a 10-year partnership on a streaming service that will allow fans to watch every game without local blackouts or restrictions. The service will be available exclusively through the Apple TV app beginning next year.The deal is Apple's second venture into streaming professional sports. In April, it began airing ""Friday Night Baseball,"" an exclusive weekly doubleheader of Major League Baseball games.""The opportunity to partner with a sports league, and truly build the product together with them is very, very unique,"" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services. ""We can bring the things that we do really well with the things that they do really well and really make the product, which I think will be significantly better for the fans. We want to create a great experience for fans to be able to watch and experience MLS like they've never had before.""MLS Commissioner Don Garber said Apple is not paying a rights fee but rather a minimum guarantee against revenues that will be generated with both selling subscriptions.Toronto FC coach Bob Bradley adds voice to gun control debate, says change is needed""It's part of what we both wanted. We're in business together,"" Garber said.People with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press that the minimum guarantee is worth $250 million per year. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't at liberty to publicly discuss financial matters.Sports Business Journal was the first to report about the minimum guarantee.The details of the streaming service will be announced in the coming months. The package will be included for fans who have full-season ticket packages for their club.Some MLS and Leagues Cup matches will be available at no additional cost to Apple TV+ subscribers, with a limited number of matches also available for free.""We really couldn't have found a better partner to embark on this new journey together to capitalize on the momentum that exists in MLS today,"" Garber said. ""We can use this deal as rocket fuel as we build towards the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico in 2026 and thinking about what the sport of soccer, what Major League Soccer could look like, in the years beyond.""Currently, most MLS out-of-market games are streamed on ESPN+, but there are blackout restrictions due to some local rights agreements. The league's deals with Fox Sports and ESPN expire at the end of the year. ESPN has carried games since the league began in 1996 and Fox since 2014. Garber is hoping the league can reach a deal with a broadcast partner.Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber, pictured in 2021, is thrilled about the new streaming deal with Apple.   (Katharine Lotze/Getty Images)Simulcast some games nationallyEven with the Apple deal, MLS does have the opportunity to simulcast some games nationally.Streaming is already built into soccer fans' DNA. The league said it has found in various studies that 83% of MLS fans watch sports on streaming devices or recorded TV in a typical week, much higher than the general average of 52% for all TV viewers.What also makes the deal intriguing for Apple is that MLS has the youngest and most diverse audience compared to the other four major professional North American sports leagues.MLS ROUNDUPCF Montreal falls to Real Salt Lake for 2nd straight loss following 8-game unbeaten runBesides all regular-season and postseason matches, the package includes all Leagues Cup matches — the competition between MLS and Mexico's Liga MX — as well as select MLS NEXT Pro and MLS NEXT matches.Apple will also partner with MLS on presentation of the matches as the league takes over production. This is another step forward for the league, but is similar to the way European soccer leagues do business. All matches will be called in English and Spanish while those involving Canadian clubs will also be available in French.All matches will also be available in Full HD (1080p) for the first time. Previously, matches were broadcast in 1080i or 720p.Garber said the league will have a more streamlined schedule beginning next season, with most matches being played on Saturdays at 7 p.m. local time and some on Wednesdays. The only time that might change is for a national broadcast or stadium conflict. The league will expand to 29 teams in 2023 with the debut of St. Louis CITY SC.The deal comes as Apple is also exploring opportunities with other sports. The company has been pursuing streaming NFL games when the league's ""Sunday Ticket"" expires at the end of the upcoming season."
10,"When stocks, houses and crypto fall, where does all that money go?","Seven months ago, there was a celebratory mood in the air for crypto traders as the two best-known cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, shot to new highs.Advocates said ""told you so,"" as financial journalists reported that the value of the global crypto market had soared to a stunning new record of about $3 trillion US.A trillion — a million millions, or a one followed by 12 zeros — is one of those numbers so big it is hard to grasp in comparison to our daily lives. A trillion dollars would buy more than 1.3 million Canadian homes. If you kept it in cash, it would give you $1 million a day in spending money for 3,000 years.But as crypto markets collapsed this week, the value of that pile of global cryptocurrencies has fallen from that $3 trillion to less than $1 trillion US. In other words, the value of 2.6 million Canadian houses just vanished. The obvious question, especially for those who jumped into the market at the peak, possibly on the advice of movie star Matt Damon that fortune favours the brave, is: ""Where did all that money go?""""That value has just kind of disappeared,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist with the Bank of Montreal.""We're seeing it in stock markets and starting to see it in the housing market in Canada as well,"" he said. ""The value of bonds is [also] coming down pretty quickly.""When that kind of money evaporates from the economy, said Guatieri, it has a serious slowing effect as people and businesses spend less.Markets tumbleAs we talked, markets of all kinds — not just crypto — were tumbling. The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index was down nearly three per cent, the S&P 500 was off nearly four per cent, and the NASDAQ nearly five per cent.Bitcoin and its ilk may feel like a special case because many people refer to cryptocurrencies as money. But, of course, it isn't.As three economists I spoke to Monday were all careful to remind me, what's disappearing is not really money, but value. For the most part, there are just as many stocks, houses and bitcoins out there in the world; they're just worth less today.Crypto market crashes anew as trading platform Celsius freezes up""This is actually one of the issues I remember struggling with hardest when I first got interested in markets,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist with Capital Economics.Actor Matt Damon appears in an ad for Crypto.com, comparing crypto investors to brave historic risk-takers and explorers. It first aired at a time when cryptocurrencies were at a peak. (Crypto.com)People first getting into markets have likely heard the statement that for every buyer, there is a seller. And they may take that to mean that as markets fall, there are a whole lot of sellers sucking all this money out of the markets, getting rich in the process.But as Brown and others said, that is simply not the case. It takes relatively few trades to set the new market price.""When a stock tumbles and an investor loses money, the money doesn't get redistributed to someone else,"" the website Investopedia outlines.As Brown explained, the reason is partly because of the way we talk about market prices. When we say bitcoin traded at $60,000 US last November, we imply all of the more than 19 million bitcoin in circulation were each worth $60,000.Platforms seized up Economists call that ""price-setting at the margin"" — sort of the leading edge of trading as prices rise or fall. If the last trade in bitcoin was at $60,000, we say ""bitcoins are worth $60,000."" But if the last trade was around $23,000, as it was on Monday morning, we say ""bitcoins are worth $23,000"" — even though the vast majority of bitcoins did not change hands in either case.In fact, when people tried to sell on Monday, market platforms seized up.""We value the entire market based on the marginal product that's sold,"" said Brown. ""And that is why you can have these extreme moves in the total value of the underlying instrument, even though that doesn't intuitively make any sense.""AnalysisSimple explanations for market ups and downs often prove unreliable: Don PittisWhat we do know is that if we tried to sell our bitcoins right now, we would get something closer to $23,000, rather than $60,000.Whether bitcoin, stocks or the price of our homes, we don't have to buy and sell the ones we own ourselves to cause the notional value of those untraded assets to rise or fall.WATCH | As interest rates rise and investors flee, cryptocurrencies collapse: Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies collapse as investors flee risky assets2 days agoDuration 1:55Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in freefall as investors flee risky assets amid rising interest rates. The world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform, Binance, has also temporarily suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals.""If one person is willing to pay a million dollars for a house, then suddenly we say all the houses are worth a million dollars,"" said Brown, even though the next house or the one after likely won't sell for the same price.And if everyone tried to sell their house at the same time to get their money out, the price of all the houses would fall sharply, explained Mikal Skuterud, a professor of economics at Ontario's University of Waterloo.Into thin airThe difference between the housing market and stocks, crypto or bonds is that houses sell more slowly, one by one. And in a falling market, individuals can withdraw their house from the market if they think the price is too low.But just as with other markets, the valuation of houses depends on so-called ""motivated sellers"" — the ones who actually do buy and sell, and are willing to accept a lower bid. AnalysisNewest homebuyers could pay the price for Canada's financial stabilityWhen markets go through sharp declines, they often rebound somewhat in following days. On Monday, traders were reacting to Friday's U.S. inflation rate, noted Brown, that came in at an unexpectedly high 8.6 per cent, leading to fears of higher or more interest rate hikes as the Federal Reserve meets later this week. ""We basically take the view that inflation has now become such a problem that central banks across the world need to engineer a pretty sizable tightening of financial conditions,"" said Brown. ""That's why we think there are further falls in equity markets to come.""If markets do see more declines in coming months, as Investopedia says, expect more value to melt away: ""Essentially, it has disappeared into thin air.""Nearly 1 in 4 homeowners say they'd have to sell home if interest rates rise more, according to surveyFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

On June 1, the central bank increased its key interest rate by half a percentage point, to 1.5 per cent.Low interest rates during the pandemic fuelled a surge in real estate demand that led housing prices to soar. ""Some Canadians made decisions to take their mortgages out based on what they could be approved for and maybe didn't get some financial advice to say, well, 'I know I can get approved for a mortgage at this particular level, but what can I actually afford?'"" said Lysa Fitzgerald, vice-president of sales at Manulife. WATCH | Warning for homeowners:Bank of Canada warns homeowners of increasing mortgage rates6 days agoDuration 6:50Personal finance columnist Rubina Ahmed-Haq says the Bank of Canada is making sure people are prepared for higher mortgage payments in the years to come.But Fitzgerald says it's important to remember that the survey is an indication of how Canadians feel about their financial situation rather than a reflection of their actual financial risk.""There is a lot of speculation that is going on out there,"" she said.

12,Crypto market crashes anew as trading platform Celsius freezes up,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged through the weekend and into Monday as high inflation sent investors running for the exits and caused major trading platforms to seize up.Bitcoin was changing hands below $23,000 US at one point on Monday morning, down 20 per cent since Friday and enough to push the value of the world's dominant cryptocurrency down to its lowest point since December 2020.The sell-off prompted a major crypto exchange, called Celsius, to halt withdrawals on Sunday evening, meaning investors can't access their funds. ""We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations,"" said the exchange, which had roughly $11 billion in customer deposits on its books.Celsius was offering depositors returns of more than 18 per cent in exchange for keeping their cryptocurrencies on the company's platform. Another crypto platform Terra offered similar yields on customer deposits. But that was before a surge in customer withdrawals prompted the collapse of Luna, the company's so-called ""stablecoin,"" which lost 99 per cent of its value in May.""They were promoting their services as a better savings account, but in the end, you're just another unsecured lender,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, who has been publicly skeptical of Celsius' business model for years. ""This was yet another bank run.""Unlike with conventional lenders such as banks that are highly regulated, most cryptocurrency platforms are not backstopped by deposit insurance like the Canada Deposit Insurance Corp., which ensures deposits at regulated institutions up to a certain dollar amount. That means depositors will not necessarily be able to get all of their money even if and when trading resumes.AnalysisWith so many cryptocurrencies, why do any of them have value?AnalysisCrypto markets tumble and investors get their fingers burnedQuebec's pension plan, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, is one of the financial backers of Celsius, having participated in a $400 million investment into the platform last November.""Celsius has been impacted by very difficult markets in recent weeks, more specifically, the strong volume of withdrawals by customers,"" a spokesperson for the pension plan told CBC News in a statement. ""Celsius is taking proactive action to uphold its obligations to its customers … and has honoured its obligation to its customers to date. Our team is closely monitoring the situation.""Other crypto exchanges seize upOther major crypto exchanges also had problems dealing with the deluge of trading orders, with Binance saying it has ""temporarily paused"" Bitcoin withdrawals.Other crypto trading platforms announced staffing cuts. Crypto.com — which made a big splash with a glitzy ad featuring Matt Damon extolling the virtues of cryptocurrency that aired during the Superbowl — announced it would be laying off about five per cent of its workforce, or about 260 people, CEO Kris Marszalek said on Twitter.That means making difficult and necessary decisions to ensure continued and sustainable growth for the long term by making targeted reductions of approximately 260 or 5% of our corporate workforce.&mdash;@krisAnother cryptocurrency company, BlockFi, announced that it was in the process of laying off 20 per cent of its staff.""This decision was driven by market conditions that have had a negative impact on our growth rate and a rigorous review of our strategic priorities,"" the company said in a blog post.The sell-off brought the total value of all cryptocurrencies below $1 trillion US, a threshold it has not dipped below since January 2021. The value of crypto assets peaked at about $2.9 trillion in November 2021 before countries around the world started seeing inflation rise to its highest point in decades. On Friday, data showed the U.S. inflation rate rose to 8.6 per cent in May, the highest level in more than 40 years. Investors and market watchers had hoped the figure would ease from the 8.3 per cent level it hit the previous month, but instead it went even higher, a troubling sign that central bank efforts, such as rate hikes to rein in inflation, aren't working.Ed Moya, senior market strategist at foreign exchange firm Oanda, said the cryptocurrency market is showing signs of capitulation.""There's fears everyone got inflation wrong,"" he said in an interview. ""You're seeing every risky asset get sold, and with crypto being the riskiest, it's under tremendous selling pressure.""Colin Cieszynski, a strategist with SIA Wealth Management in Toronto, said high inflation is causing investors to run away from anything deemed to be risky.""Cryptocurrencies are still kind of an emerging market that people were trading when they were feeling good, when they were enthusiastic when they were willing to take on risk and when they had access to cheap money to do so,"" he said in an interview Monday. ""A lot of those factors have changed over the last few months … what we've seen over the last few days, in particular, and why we've had this new sell off, is a sense that money is becoming more expensive.""Buy and 'hodl'?Not all crypto owners are rattled, however. Lucah Rosenberg-Lee, a retail investor from Toronto who has owned Bitcoin since 2017, has seen strong gains over years despite frequent crashes.Like many in the space, Rosenberg-Lee abides by the ""hodl"" mindset — a meme on the investment concept of holding that is also an acronym meaning ""hold on for dear life,"" and never sell when panic sets in, as he describes it.He has about half of his investments in cryptocurrency and has no plans to divest.""I'm just going to keep it as long as I can,"" he told CBC in an interview. ""I have not bought more today, but I think there are a lot of people who are going to.""""In terms of going back up, it will 100 per cent go back up, it's just about when,"" he said.Stock markets also sell offCryptocurrencies weren't the only market walloped by stubbornly high inflation Monday. Stock markets around the world plunged precipitously, as speculation mounts that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points on Wednesday, as it scrambles to rein in runaway increases in the cost of living.Major U.S. markets including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the technology-focused Nasdaq were all down by between three and five per cent.The decline for the S&P brings the broadest U.S. stock index down more than 20 per cent from its highs, which means it has met the technical requirement of a bear market.Things were no better in Toronto with the benchmark TSX stock index off 532 points, or almost three per cent.All 11 subgroups of the index, from energy to banks, technology and health care, were lower.Bank of Canada all but certain to raise lending rates this week — with more hikes to come"

He said the oilpatch is fine, despite supply chain and labour problems, when compared to the dire commodity prices that hit the industry in 2020. (Kyle Bakx/CBC)Prices spiked after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February sent the market into turmoil. Initially, many expected the exorbitant prices wouldn't last, but sanctions on Russia and recovering economies are offering crude prices staying power.""This is a long way from the downturn,"" said Hayden Binde, marketing associate with Montana-based BioSqueeze, which focuses on sealing leaks from oil and gas wells. Binde was one of hundreds of people in Calgary last week for the Global Energy Show, a conference and trade show.

For now, demand remains robust.""There really isn't anything we can point to near-term that's going to cause an easing of prices. In fact, we could see prices lift, especially during the summer driving season,"" O'Brien said.Gas prices have never been higher — but Canadians still aren't jumping on public transitAlberta's carbon capture rollout plan criticized by industry over transparency, costsLike many other industries, the oilpatch is struggling to find enough workers, especially to go work in the oil and natural gas fields across the Prairies and into northeast British Columbia. Inflation and supply chain problems are also causing some rising costs and delays.Still, the commodity boom far outweighs those challenges as the whole industry gets a financial lift.""That's great for the economy, that's great for morale, that's great for the rest of us who are feeding into the oil and gas industry,"" said Adesua Eigbe, sales manager with Total Combustion Inc., which rents equipment to companies needing to dispose of waste gas.    ""That's job security, so I'm excited."""
15,Phone won't stop buzzing after work? How right-to-disconnect policies might help — and might not,"Many Ontario employers were required to have a right-to-disconnect policy by the beginning of this month, but experts say the vague legislation might not stop the after-hours emails and calls as readily as some employees might hope. The plan was conceived in the depth of the pandemic when many Ontarians began working remotely. Advocates hoped the provincial government's right-to-disconnect policy, which forms a section of the Working for Workers Act, would address work-life balance. Employment lawyers and human resource management professionals say it's a positive first step and may contribute to shifts in some work cultures, but many say it relies too much on a good employer to get it right.""The legislation is quite toothless,"" said Matthew Fisher, a partner at Lecker & Associates Law who specializes in employment law. ""What it really does is it requires employers of a certain size in certain circumstances to make a policy,"" he added.""The problem is they are relying on the good faith of employers.... There is nothing in the legislation that requires the policy to be reasonable.""Ontario employers with more than 25 workers were supposed to have written policies in place by June 2 to detail how employees can disengage from work-related communications. (Shutterstock / Prostock-studio)June 2, 2022, was the deadline for Ontario employers with more than 25 workers to have written policies in place. They're supposed to detail how employees can disengage from work-related communications, including emails, audio and video calls and sending or receiving messages when they are meant to be off the clock. The policy may or may not include details related to time of day, the types of communication that are acceptable and who can contact an employee out of work hours.Fisher says hypothetically a cynical employer could make a policy saying employees ""have a right to disconnect between four and 4:15 am on Tuesday.""A win for good employers?Erin Bury is the CEO of Willful, an Ontario startup that helps people with estate planning online. Bury says she pro-actively created a right-to-disconnect policy just before the Ontario legislation passed. Her company falls just below the 25 employee cut-off, but is growing, meaning it may be required to have one soon.""Prior to the pandemic, we had an office in downtown Toronto, and we were very much an in-office culture ... It was pretty easy to disconnect, because you would just physically leave the office,"" she said.But the company is now operating remotely with some employees in other time zones, meaning someone in British Columbia might send an email to someone in Toronto after normal working hours, she says.Ontario proposing new law that would require businesses to tell staff how they're being tracked onlinePandemic puts 'right to disconnect' in spotlight as provinces inch toward policiesThe company's right-to-disconnect policy encourages employees to schedule emails, turn off their chat notifications on their phones after hours and consider sending a video message instead of holding a late meeting, she says.The policy also indicates that while there might be times when tasks are required after hours, if it becomes a pattern there is a recourse for the employee, whether it's management addressing the cause or offering lieu time.Bury says Willful's policy has been positively received. She would have liked to have seen the government's policy as mandatory for smaller firms, noting the startup culture can lead to overworked employees. Steph Little, a senior HR consultant with Bright + Early, says all all the talk about the legislation has amounted to better policies, even if the legislation itself is weak. (Submitted: Steph Little)The confusion around the legislation has broadly led to positive action by good actors, says Steph Little, a senior human resources consultant with Bright + Early, a Toronto-based HR consultancy company.Good employers, including some who have fewer than 25 employees and don't legally need a policy, were encouraged by the discussions around the topic, she says. Employers wanted ""to be more proactive, to get ahead of the policy and put things in place to make sure people can disconnect.""Her clients have reported better productivity and organization from managers and employees alike when people have realized they must get it all done within business hours. Spelling out work norms that come off as sound and desirable is ""really attractive for candidates and appreciated with existing employees as well,"" she said.Too much at employer's discretionThe problem is not all companies will be keen to go beyond what the law requires, which isn't much, says Daniel Lublin, an employment lawyer and founding partner at Whitten & Lublin, based in downtown Toronto.""Few companies are going to shackle themselves with an inability to call on employees for urgent situations after hours,"" he said. ""It's fake to call it a right to disconnect,"" he said, because so much comes down to the employer's discretion of whether they want that to be the case. What if it were against the law for your boss to bug you after hours?Happiness columnWhy we need to be OK with not checking in on work when we're off: Jennifer Moss""It really comes down again, to whether an employer has made a choice to actually create a substantive right or not,"" he said.But for firms that do embed the right to truly disconnect into their policy, it does mean employees could go to the Ministry of Labour if they were admonished, suspended or terminated for failing to respond to something outside of the timeframe spelled out in the policy. Nita Chhinzer, a professor of human resources and business consulting at the University of Guelph, says unfortunately bad employers are likely to continue to be a problem despite the new policy. (Submitted: Nita Chhinzer)Nita Chhinzer, a professor of HR and business consulting at the University of Guelph, says companies that traditionally violate employment law ""are not suddenly going to start abiding by this one law when they haven't been abiding by others.""Predatory employers will continue to do what they like and ""lead by a culture of fear,"" Chhinzer says.However, ""it's going to positively provide employees with a path of correction,"" and the intent to reduce burnout that comes from prolonged stress is a very good thing, she says. "

18,Does 'lady-driven' still sell cars? There are reasons to slam brakes on the term,"Used-vehicle ads can be snappy and effective, and some even go viral for their cleverness — but others miss the mark.Some are so misguided, they veer into sexism and misogyny.Enter lady-driven — for decades, the term has come to mean a car has been ""driven gently.""Today, it's considered by many to be an antiquated term. Sudbury, Ont.-born Sarah Pelletier, who lives in Ottawa, was perusing the used-vehicle section of online marketplace Kijiji in the Greater Sudbury Area, curious about prices and availability.Her search brought up dozens of ads, and some of them frustrated her.She posted the following tweet, saying it made her ""angry for so many reasons.""What is WITH people (in Northern Ontario, specifically) posting used cars for sale on Kijiji with ""lady driven"" in the description!? This makes me angry for so many reasons.&mdash;@sfpelletier1In a later email to CBC News, Pelletier said, ""This language got under my skin because driving can't and shouldn't be gendered.""The act of driving, adhering to the rules of the road, paying attention to obstructions, are not inherent skills, traits, qualities of a particular gender, but perhaps stem from the way that folks might be taught to drive differently and have different expectations imposed on them because of their gender or how they present.""The term also focuses on women and men, leaving gender-diverse people out of the conversation.'Clear is the new clever'CBC reached out to the four Kijiji ad posters that Pelletier tweeted about, and asked them about the condition of their vehicles and what they meant by the term lady-driven.Two of the four ignored the message. Sarah Pelletier was frustrated after seeing the term 'lady-driven' pop up in her search for used vehicles on Kijiji. Pelletier, who was born in Sudbury and now lives in Ottawa, feels it's sexist, old-fashioned, and left out gender diverse and non-binary people. (Submitted by Sarah Pelletier)However, the third responded: ""Apologies for wording the statement that way,"" and explained the vehicle's condition. And the four poster said that to them, lady-driven means, ""Grandma never went four wheeling with it in bush or drag racing.""Half the listings are still on the site.So is the term an effective marketing strategy?Not really, according to an expert, according to experts.""As we progress, learn and grow as a society, that term [lady-driven] might not necessarily be the right one to use for some individuals,"" said Jean Beauchemin, a business professor at Cambrian College in Sudbury. ""I'd suggest you get to know your customer base and really engage in those discussions, and that could help you create long-term partnerships.""Clear is the new clever.""Beauchemin said the strength of the product outweighs gimmicks when it comes to making a sale.Dispelling myths about female driversThere are two conflicting myths surrounding female drivers: They're gentler with their vehicles than men, and they're bad drivers. Neither really matters when a mechanic pops the hood.Jean Beauchemin, a Cambrian College professor, says while 'lady-driven' might have been an effective marketing term years ago, it's no longer widely accepted. Instead, he says, clear is the new clever. (Submitted by Jean Beauchemin)Stefanie Bruinsma, an automotive service technician from Kitchener, Ont., said relating gender to the type of shape a vehicle is in or its appropriateness for certain individuals is ""ridiculous."" ""It's not even correct. So mostly, it makes me laugh and a little bit sad that we're still here,"" said Bruinsma, who's with the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research at the University of Waterloo, where she's manager of industry engagement. Bruinsma runs a business called Auto Cate, which aims to educate vehicle owners to prevent them from getting swindled at an auto shop.Recently, her 72-year-old mother was in a car accident with her Toyota Matrix. Bruinsma said that while her mother felt OK, she complained of bad knee pain after her legs smashed into the dashboard on impact.Bruinsma's mother was driving with her adjustable seat all the way forward to reach the gas and brake pedals and to see over the dashboard. Her injuries are common in women who have experienced a collision. ""When engineers design the interior, all the functions around the car in terms of how high should the engine be for an average person and how do they get in and out of the car, how should you make the seat for the average height and weight of a person — all those constraints and numbers are based on the average male body,"" said Bruinsma.""Which means, quite literally, cars aren't built for the average woman or the average human. So women statistically are injured more in car accidents.""The tall and short of itIn addition to being more prone to collision injuries, people of shorter stature face driving inconveniences and challenges, even when it comes to otherwise banal actions like braking and accelerating.One of Bruinsma's friends, a small woman, was complaining to her about how she hates to drive. When asked why, she told Bruinsma she had to physically lift her foot up and move it to the brake pedal, then back to the gas pedal.""One, it's exhausting her poor muscles in her leg, and two, it would make her 100 per cent more of a jerky driver,"" said Bruinsma.The friend's size, of course, was not taken into consideration when the vehicle was designed.The alternative action for someone taller is to keep the foot on one pedal and pivot at the ankle, since that person's feet are bigger and legs are longer.Bruinsma herself is tall for a woman and had never even considered that shorter people have to find a workaround. Lady-driven fails to encompass the issues surrounding smaller drivers, like design, safety and jerky acceleration.It might not even help sell the car, experts note.As Beauchemin said: There's no need to turn to gimmicks or snappy but inaccurate language — just be transparent.LISTEN | Up North producer Bridget Yard talks to host Jonathan Pinto about the term lady-driven:Up North9:20A deep dive into the term ""lady driven""You see it all over Kijiji auto ads: lady driven. It's meant to convey that the vehicle in question was driven gently, but it has sexist implications.

That more than offset a decline of 96,000 part-time positions.The jobless rate inched down for the third month in a row, settling at the lowest point it's been since comparable record-keeping began in 1976.May's hiring surge adds to the expansion that Canada's economy has seen in recent months. After shedding more than three million jobs in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada's job market has slowly and steadily recovered. Booming demand for workersBy November 2021, Canada finally had the same number of workers it had before the pandemic. When May's numbers are included, it now has half a million more than it did then.The balance between job vacancies and workers has almost completely shifted from one of imbalance to one where employers can't find enough people to work. ""As we commence the ritual of filling patios and hit the road for overdue vacations, employers continue to search for workers to meet heightened demand,"" TD Bank economist James Orlando said of the numbers. ""This has job vacancy rates at record levels, making it clear that the Canadian economy is operating beyond full employment.""Serving staff are shown at a Canadian Brewhouse's location in Victoria.
